The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s phone, and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data.

Residents in Singapore seeking to travel to China for essential business or official travel via the RGL must be sponsored by either a company or a government agency in China, which will file an application on behalf of the applicant with the local provincial/municipal authorities.

The approved applicant will thereafter submit a visa application and health declaration to the PRC Embassy in Singapore, which will issue the applicant a visa. The requirement to obtain a visa also applies to Singaporeans visiting China for less than 15 days, as the 15-day visa free facility for Singaporeans travelling to China remains suspended by the PRC government until further notice. For more details on visa application, please contact the PRC Embassy in Singapore.

The RGL is for travel between Singapore and the six RGL regions in China (Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Zhejiang).

After the first 14 days, inter-provincial/municipal travel for the non-RGL regions within China will be allowed for a RGL traveller from Singapore, as long as he/she adheres to the same domestic travel restrictions imposed on residents in China to move between those provinces/municipalities concerned.

As some provinces/municipalities may require additional COVID-19 test(s) before the traveller is allowed to embark on inter-provincial/municipal travel, the traveller’s local host company or government agency should check with the relevant local provincial/municipality authorities if there are any such requirements.

#### 7.	Who can I contact for more information on the arrangements in China, e.g., accommodation and transport?

The traveller may contact his/her host company or government agency in China to make the necessary arrangements in China.

Testing for RGL arrangements should only be carried out at these clinics at the moment. An eligible RGL traveller should contact the clinic directly for testing.

The traveller will need to adhere to the clinic’s cut-off timings for the pre-departure tests to ensure that he/she is able to obtain the test results in time to be allowed to check-in for his/her flight.

The traveller must also obtain a letter from the PRC Embassy in Singapore which confirms that he/she has been granted approval by the relevant authorities in China to travel to China under the Singapore-China RGL. This letter will be used as an indication of the traveller’s eligibility to take a pre-departure COVID-19 test. This letter must be presented at the clinic before the test can be administered.

The traveller should expect to pay up to S$200 (inclusive of GST) for the pre-departure test. This is not payable by MediSave, MediShield Life and Integrated Shield Plans.

#### 9. I had a swab done previously for Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI). Can I use the test results for travel under the RGL?

Travellers with ARI symptoms should not travel. They should postpone their travel plans.

A RGL traveller to China will be subject to a PCR test and a serology test upon arrival.<sup>1</sup>

#### 11. What if I test positive for COVID-19 in China?

If tested positive for COVID-19 in China, the traveller will be accorded the necessary medical treatment by the local government at his/her cost.

#### 12. I have completely recovered from COVID-19, but may still test positive on the post-arrival serology test in China. May I still travel to China?

The Chinese authorities require a traveller to test negative for both the post-arrival PCR test and serology test before the traveller can proceed with his/her travel plans in China.

### **Pre-Departure in Singapore**

#### 13. What documentation do I need to present to the airline staff at check-in before I will be allowed to board a flight from Singapore to China?

Minimally, a traveller should have on hand his/her negative COVID-19 PCR test result, a valid visa and a Letter of Invitation issued by the Chinese provincial/municipal authorities of Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin or Zhejiang specifically for essential business or official travel under the RGL.

As the specific requirements may vary amongst provinces/municipalities, the traveller should verify the latest requirements with his/her local host company or government agency.

### **Health Measures in China**

#### 14. Do I need to be quarantined upon arrival in China?

After undergoing a PCR test and serology test upon arrival, the traveller must remain in a centralised quarantine area designated by the local provincial/municipal government for one to two days until the test results are released. The traveller has to bear the costs of the post-arrival tests and the one to two days’ stay in the designated location.

If the traveller tests negative for both COVID-19 tests, the host company or government agency will transport the traveller directly from the above-mentioned location designated by the local provincial/municipal government to the workplace or residence.

#### 15. What other health measures will I be subject to in China? What would qualify as a “controlled itinerary” in China?

The traveller must follow local COVID-19 prevention and control measures for the duration of his/her stay in China, including downloading the local health QR code used in the province/municipality.

While a traveller no longer needs to adhere to a controlled itinerary after the first 14 days, he/she must still follow local COVID-19 prevention and control measures for the duration of his/her stay in China. As some provinces/municipalities may require the traveller to undergo additional COVID-19 test(s) before being allowed to move beyond a controlled itinerary after the first 14 days, your local host company or government agency should verify the latest requirements with the relevant local provincial/municipality authorities.

Singapore-based travellers returning from their travel on the Singapore-China RGL will be exempted from the prevailing SHN policy applicable to incoming travellers to Singapore, if they:

*Example:*
*If a traveller’s departure flight time for China is 12pm on 30 September, the required test must be done within 72 hours of departure, i.e., the traveller should take the test from 12pm on 27 September onwards, until the cut-off timing at 4pm on 28 September.*

##### 3. How can I make an appointment for pre-departure PCR testing?

For RGL travel to China, the pre-departure PCR test must be done within 72 hours prior to departure.

Please call the clinic and book your test slot before the Cut-Off Test Timing in the schedule above. This is to ensure that you will have sufficient time to meet the RGL requirements.

##### 4. How far in advance should I make an appointment for the pre-departure PCR test?

Due to limited slots, please make your appointment with the clinic **as early as possible**, once your flight timing and your RGL application is approved.

Please refer to the **Schedule for the “Latest Cut-off Test Timing” and book your test slot within the indicated timing**. This is to ensure that you meet the RGL requirements.

If you do not make a prior appointment, please note that:
1. There is no guarantee that there will be a test slot for you; and
2. You may not get your results in time for your flight to qualify for RGL arrangements.

Travellers who miss the cut-off test timing will <u>not</u> be able to obtain a test result in time for their flight.

Please have the following information on hand when making an appointment for your test:

4. Possible times for your test slot: Please refer to the Test Schedule to confirm your timing

##### Testing

##### 7. What if I miss my test timing? What if I take my test after the Cut-off Test Timing?

Travellers who miss the Cut-off Test Timing will not be able to obtain a test result in time for their flight.

Please make arrangements early for your test slot so that you can qualify for the RGL arrangements.

##### 8. What happens if the clinic assesses that I am unable to receive the PCR test for unforeseen circumstances?

If you are unable to receive the test, you may wish to reschedule your flight, if you still wish to tap on the RGL arrangement.

You will receive your PCR test results and memo at least three hours before your flight.
