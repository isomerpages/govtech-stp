### **Health Measures in Singapore**

#### 24. What health measures will I be subjected to upon arrival in Singapore? 

Travellers must take a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival in Singapore and remain isolated in a declared self-sourced accommodation until their test results are released (typically within 48 hours). The traveller’s declared accommodation during the first 14 days of their stay in Singapore must not be a residential address.  Transportation from the airport/land checkpoints to the declared accommodation will have to be provided by the host company or government agency subject to prevailing health measures<sup>1</sup>.  Travellers will bear the costs of the post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test in Singapore and stay in the declared accommodation.

If the result indicates that the traveller has tested negative for COVID-19, the host company or government agency will ensure that the traveller is transported directly from the declared accommodation to the workplace and back according to the submitted controlled itinerary for the traveller’s stay in Singapore. The traveller may not use public transportation for this purpose, except for private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport<sup>2</sup>. 

Throughout the duration of the traveller’s controlled itinerary, he/she is not allowed access to common facilities or amenities in the declared accommodation, that are not within the ambit of activities related to the conduct of business activities. Such examples include gyms, swimming pools, sauna facilities or any other recreational places.

Travellers to Singapore must use the TraceTogether app and SafeEntry<sup><a href="#Q24">Q26</a></sup>, take twice daily temperatures, report their health status to the host company or government agency, and adhere to prevailing public health requirements for the duration of stay in Singapore.

#### 25. What is the TraceTogether app? Does the Singapore Government track my movements via the app? 

The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s phone and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data. 

The app works best on phones with Android version 5.1 and above, as well as phones with iOS version 10 and above. More information on the app can be found [here](https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/).

<div id="Q24"></div>

#### 26. What is SafeEntry?

SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that logs the NRIC/FIN and mobile numbers of individuals visiting hotspots, workplaces of essential services, as well as selected public venues to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 through activities such as contact tracing and identification of COVID-19 clusters.

An existing check-in method is via scanning of a QR code at the venue with a camera phone or a QR scanner app. Hence, you are encouraged to purchase a Singapore local data SIM card, or connect your mobile phone to a Singapore local Wi-Fi network to access the form for this mode of check-in. 
 
Alternatively, some venues allow you to complete SafeEntry by presenting your passport as identification. Establishments will assist visitors with manual SafeEntry check-in.

More information on the system can be found [here](https://www.safeentry.gov.sg/).
