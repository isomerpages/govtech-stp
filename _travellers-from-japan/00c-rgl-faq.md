Persons of all nationalities who are legally resident in Japan and who need to make single-entry, short-term essential travel for business or official purposes between Singapore and Japan.

#### 2. I am a Singapore Citizen / Singapore Permanent Resident / Singapore Long-Term Pass holder* who is resident in Japan. Am I eligible to apply for the RGL?

Yes. All residents in Japan who need to make short-term essential business or official travel between Singapore and Japan are eligible to apply for the RGL.

<p style="font-size: 1.0rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">* <em>Singapore Long-Term Pass holders who are eligible to apply for RGL travel include holders of MOM-issued work passes (e.g. Employment Pass, EntrePass, Personalised Employment Pass, S Pass, Work Permit, Dependant’s Pass) and holders of the ICA-issued Long-Term Visit Pass.</em></p>

#### 3. What is a SafeTravel Pass?

A SafeTravel Pass is required for residents in Japan to seek entry into Singapore under the RGL.

Travellers must enter Singapore within this stipulated week, and can stay in Singapore for the duration of their Visit Pass issued at the immigration checkpoint in Singapore.

SafeTravel Passes will be issued on a limited basis in order to manage the risk of imported COVID-19 cases.

Please send an email to <COVID_SafeTravelEnquiries@mti.gov.sg> if you have further queries related to the SafeTravel Pass.

#### 4. How do residents in Japan apply to travel to Singapore under the RGL? What are the steps from the time I put in an application to the time I obtain a visa? How long is the processing time? What documents do I need to submit?

Residents in Japan seeking to travel to Singapore via the RGL must be hosted by a company or a government agency in Singapore. The host company can file the application for a SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller either directly at <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO>, or through a sponsoring government agency.<sup>1</sup>

When applying for the SafeTravel Pass, Proof of Residency in Japan is required. Japanese nationals should present a copy of their passport page, while foreign residents in Japan should present a copy of their Residence Cards. The applicant will also be required to submit the controlled itinerary for the traveller(s)’ first 14 days of stay in Singapore, which is limited to travel between places of business and accommodation, with limited contact with the community.

The application for the SafeTravel Pass will be open 2 to 5 weeks before the week of the traveller’s planned departure. The processing of the application can take up to 7 days (excluding the day of application). You are encouraged to apply for the SafeTravel Pass as early as possible, factoring in the time necessary for the processing of the SafeTravel Pass application, visa application (if needed) and taking a pre-departure COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test before departure to Singapore.

When the SafeTravel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be issued to the sponsoring company / government agency by email. With this letter, an approved applicant who is a visa-required passport holder will proceed to apply for a visa for travel to Singapore through the usual channels (Singapore overseas missions, authorised visa agents, local contact or companies) at least 4 working days before departure. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status [here](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save).

Those who did not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will not need to apply for a visa for RGL travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

The approved applicant will have to submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations as well as declare his/her accommodation electronically via the SG Arrival Card, within 3 days prior to the date of arrival in Singapore.

Prior to the traveller’s departure from Japan, the sponsoring company or government agency should submit the traveller’s **certificate of negative result for COVID-19 PCR test** taken within 72 hours before departure and **latest** controlled itinerary in Singapore at <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO>.

The traveller is required to present his/her valid SafeTravel Pass, certificate of negative result for a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test which should be in English or accompanied by an English translation, return air ticket or proof of other transportation arrangements to depart Singapore, and valid visa (for visa-required passport holders) for pre-boarding checks at the airlines check-in counter and immigration counter. Otherwise, he/she may be refused boarding.

#### 5.	What are the responsibilities of the host company?

When a company applies for the SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller, it is also responsible for the timely submission of the accompanying documents.

The host company should also ensure that the traveller abides by the terms and conditions of the Singapore-Japan RGL, and the prevailing health measures during his/her stay in Singapore. Authorities may ask for proof of adherence to the controlled itinerary, including physical verification or SafeEntry Pass records (e.g. screenshots), and other terms and conditions when the traveller is in Singapore.

You can access the terms and conditions of the Singapore-Japan RGL at <https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/japan/rgl/terms-and-conditions>. Action will be taken against the traveller and the host company in the event of non-compliance.

#### 6. Can tourists apply for SafeTravel Passes?

SafeTravel Passes are only issued to travellers making short-term essential business and official travel. These passes are not applicable for tourists.

#### 7. Can my SafeTravel Pass be transferred to my family member, friend, colleague or business partner?

SafeTravel Passes are not transferable to others.

#### 8.	Do I need to pay to apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

No payment is required.

#### 9. Is there a limit to the number of times I can apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

There is no limit to the number of times a traveller can apply for a SafeTravel Pass. However, please note that there may be penalties for repeated non-utilisation. Every entry to Singapore requires a new SafeTravel Pass application. 

If the traveller’s SafeTravel Pass has expired, he/she should submit a new application.


#### 10. What visa will I be eligible for under the RGL, and what is the duration of stay that I will be eligible for in Singapore? 

Every application for a visa, including the type of visa granted, will be considered on its own merits and subject to approval. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/ she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status through <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save>.

Those who did not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will not need to apply for a visa for RGL travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

Travellers who are granted entry into Singapore are generally issued with a Visit Pass, of which the duration would be aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### 11. How can I further extend my Visit Pass / stay when I am in Singapore, if necessary? 

All applications for extension of Visit Pass must be submitted online using ICA’s e-Service (<https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/extend>) at least seven days prior to the expiry of the Visit Pass to avoid overstaying. Extension of Visit Pass will not be accepted over the counter. Each application is considered on its own merits.

#### 12. My travel plans have changed/ some information in my application is incorrect. How can I amend the details of my SafeTravel Pass application/ approved SafeTravel Pass?

Both the SafeTravel Pass application and issued SafeTravel Pass cannot be amended. Please ensure that all details of the application form are accurate at the point of submission.

#### 13. What if I have changes to my controlled itinerary? 

The host company should be responsible for monitoring and reporting any deviation in your controlled itinerary. The host company should resubmit the updated controlled itinerary on behalf of the traveller via the ‘Submit Supporting Documents’ Form, at <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO>. Please have the approved STP reference number and documents on hand for submission, and ensure that the amendments or deviation from the controlled itinerary are in accordance with the stipulated guidelines.

#### 14. Can the sponsoring company / agency or traveller check the status of the SafeTravel Pass application?

The sponsoring company/agency or traveller may enquire the status of their application(s) via <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO>. Please prepare the traveller’s identification details and intended date of entry in Singapore as declared in the STP application.  

#### 15. Why was my application rejected?

SafeTravel Pass applications may be rejected for reasons, including the following:

- Inadequate justifications provided for reason of travelinformation provided.
- Non-compliant controlled itinerary submitted.
- Wrong proof of residency submitted.
 
#### 16. Can I use the RGL to come to Singapore for long-term work?

It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s phone, and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data. 

The app works best on phones with Android version 5.1 and above. More information on the app can be found at <https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg>.
