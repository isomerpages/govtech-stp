If the result indicates that the traveller has tested negative for COVID-19, the host company or government agency will ensure that the traveller is transported directly from the declared accommodation to the workplace and back according to the submitted controlled itinerary for the first 14 days of the traveller’s stay in Singapore. The traveller may not use public transportation for this purpose, with the exception of private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport.<sup>3</sup> 

Travellers to Singapore must use the TraceTogether app and SafeEntry<sup>4</sup>, take their temperature twice daily, report their health status to the host company or government agency, and adhere to prevailing public health requirements for the duration of their stay in Singapore. If the traveller subsequently tests positive for COVID-19 while in Singapore or within 14 days after departure from Singapore, he/she will be required to upload his/her TraceTogether data.

The Singapore Government takes a serious view of non-compliance with the aforementioned health measures.

#### 25.	What is the TraceTogether app? Does the Singapore Government track my movements via the app? 

The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s phone, and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data. 

The app works best on phones with Android version 5.1 and above. More information on the app can be found [here](https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg). 

#### 26.	What is SafeEntry? 

SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that logs the identification numbers and mobile numbers of individuals visiting hotspots, workplaces of essential services, as well as selected public venues to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 through activities such as contact tracing and identification of COVID-19 clusters.

#### 27.	Do I need to be tested again in Singapore before I return to Germany? Do I need to be quarantined or be tested again upon return to Germany?

There are currently no requirements set by relevant German authorities for RGL returnees to Germany to be tested again in Singapore before returning to Germany. As Singapore is currently listed as a non-risk area<sup>5</sup> by the relevant German authorities, travellers who have been to Singapore for the past 14 days and are eligible to enter Germany need not be quarantined or subjected to a COVID-19 test upon entering Germany. 

Returnees may wish to check on the specific measures taken upon entry into Germany at the website of the Federal Foreign Office of Germany, as well as the website of the Federal Land wherein you reside or will be staying for detailed information.
