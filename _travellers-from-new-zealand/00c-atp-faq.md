#### 9. Once an ATP application is approved, can the relevant authorities change the conditions of travel or even cancel the ATP?

Given the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the relevant authorities in Singapore may introduce new measures or requirements as and when necessary to safeguard public health. This may result in changes to the conditions or cancellation of the ATP at short notice. Applicants will be notified of any such changes or cancellation of their ATP.

### **Contact Tracing – TraceTogether App**

#### 19. What is the TraceTogether app? Does the Singapore Government track visitors’ movements via the app?

The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby mobile devices running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s mobile device, and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data.

#### 20. Must every visitor download the TraceTogether app?

#### 22. Can visitors switch off their mobile devices while in Singapore?
