### **Contact Tracing – TraceTogether App**

#### 22. What is the TraceTogether app? Does the Singapore Government track visitors’ movements via the app?

The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby mobile devices running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s mobile device, and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data.

#### 23. Must every visitor download the TraceTogether app?

#### 24. What happens if visitors do not have mobile devices to download the TraceTogether app?

All visitors must have a mobile device to download the TraceTogether app. They are responsible for ensuring that their mobile devices are compatible with the TraceTogether app, and may be refused boarding and entry into Singapore if they are unable to download the TraceTogether app on their mobile devices.

Children aged 12 or younger in that calendar year and travelling with a parent/guardian are exempted from this requirement. Visitors with a certified disability or special need are also exempted.

#### 25. Can visitors switch off their mobile devices while in Singapore?

A visitor who does not have any of the above may be refused boarding by the airline.

#### 28. Can visitors use the ATP to transit/transfer through Singapore?
