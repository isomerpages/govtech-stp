In view of the improved access to COVID-19 vaccines globally and the recent easing of border measures, Singapore will be suspending the vaccination channels for overseas Singaporeans (OS). OS who had earlier registered their interest to use the channels but have not yet returned to Singapore for the vaccination will have to do so by 31 March 2022.

 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/covid-19-vaccination-channels-for-overseas-singaporeans_11Sep2021">Ministry of Health</a> launched the vaccination channels on 11 September 2021 to make it more convenient for OS to return to Singapore to receive their COVID-19 vaccinations.

 
Since then, OS access to COVID-19 vaccines in their resident countries has improved and we have observed a declining number of registrations for the vaccination channels in recent months.  Singapore has also launched Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTL) with many destinations, through which OS who have completed their primary series vaccination can return to Singapore for their booster dose without serving Stay-Home Notice (SHN). The SHN duration for unvaccinated travellers has also been shortened to 7 days, and they can now serve SHN at a chosen place of residence instead of designated hotels.

 
Following the suspension of the vaccination channels, OS who wish to receive vaccine doses in Singapore can do so at the Vaccination Centres after completing their SHN, if required.
