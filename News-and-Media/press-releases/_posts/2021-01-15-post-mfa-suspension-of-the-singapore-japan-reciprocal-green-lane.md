In response to media queries, the MFA Spokesperson said:
 
 “On 26 December 2020, Japan announced a temporary ban on the entry of all non-resident foreign nationals into Japan from 28 December 2020 to 31 January 2021. The Japanese government has since announced that all of Japan’s Business Track and Residence Track arrangements with other countries, including the Singapore-Japan Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL), will be suspended from 14 January 2021 until the State of Emergency in Japan is lifted.
 
Given the reciprocal nature of the Singapore-Japan RGL and Residence Track, travellers will not be able to apply to travel from Japan to Singapore under the RGL and Residence Track during this period. Travellers who have already received approval to enter Singapore under the RGL can continue to do so but should check with the Japanese Embassy in Singapore with regard to the latest immigration regulations for their return to Japan. Singapore Work Pass Holders from Japan may continue to use the Work Pass Holder General Lane for entry into Singapore.[[1] More information on the Work Pass Holder General Lane can be found at https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/wphl/requirements-and-process/1] Long-term residents of Japan who are planning to travel to, or who are already in Singapore may also wish to check with the Japanese Embassy in Singapore on the latest regulations regarding re-entry into Japan.
 
All travellers entering Singapore will be subject to prevailing health requirements.”
