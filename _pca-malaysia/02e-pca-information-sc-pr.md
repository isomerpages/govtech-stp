### **Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) - For Singapore Citizens and  Permanent Residents applying to enter Malaysia**

The Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) is a scheme agreed between Singapore and Malaysia to allow work and business-related travel between the two countries via the land border crossings at the Johor-Singapore Causeway and Malaysia-Singapore Second Link. Singapore Citizens and Singapore Permanent Residents (PRs) who hold valid Malaysian Long-Term Social Visit Passes (i.e. Employment Pass or Professional Visit Pass) for business or work purposes may apply to enter Malaysia under the PCA. Under the PCA, they should remain in Malaysia to work for at least 90 days before returning to Singapore for home leave. The entry and exit between Singapore and Malaysia must be via Woodlands Checkpoint or Tuas Checkpoint.

For details on the application procedures and requirements for Singapore Citizens and PRs to enter Malaysia under the PCA, please visit the Immigration Department of Malaysia's website [here](https://www.imi.gov.my/portal2017/index.php/ms/sumber-dan-arkib/pengumuman/1833-malaysia-singapore-border-crossing-arrangement.html). For queries related to entering Malaysia under the PCA, please approach the Immigration Department of Malaysia.

### **Waiver of Stay-Home Notice when returning to Singapore on Short-Term Home Leave**

Singapore Citizens and PRs that have applied for or granted a Malaysia-issued PCA pass (MyTravelPass) may apply for waiver of Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for short-term home leave in Singapore, after spending at least 90 days working in Malaysia. The intent of the Malaysia-issued PCA passes is to allow Singapore Citizens and PRs to re-enter Malaysia after their home leave, to continue with their business or work. In lieu of SHN, the returnee on home leave will undergo a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival at Woodlands Checkpoint or Tuas Checkpoint in Singapore, at their own cost.

1. Malaysia-issued PCA pass (MyTravelPass), or the MyTravelPass application acknowledgement slip; and
2. Malaysia-issued Long-term Social Visit Passes for business or work purposes (e.g. Employment Pass or Professional Visit Pass).

Successful applicants will receive an approval letter containing the Terms & Conditions for the waiver granted, which the traveller is required to comply. These include the traveller’s obligation to (i) undergo the COVID-19 PCR test, which he/she will also pay for upon arrival<sup>1</sup>; and (ii) remain in self-isolation at his/her declared place of residence upon entry into Singapore, until a negative test result is conveyed to the traveller.

<p style="font-size: 1.0rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">* <em>Singapore Citizens and PRs currently working in Malaysia and do not have a Malaysia-issued PCA pass yet may apply for a PCA pass (MyTravelPass) from the Malaysian authorities, before submitting their application to ICA for SHN waiver. This Malaysia-issued PCA pass (MyTravelPass) or approval will serve as the document supporting that the traveller has confirmed his/her re-entry into Malaysia at a later date, to continue working in Malaysia under the PCA. <b>Without the Malaysia-issued PCA pass (MyTravelPass) or approval as well as the Malaysia-issued Long-term Social Visit Passes for business or work purposes (Employment Pass or Professional Visit Pass), the traveller will not be granted a waiver from SHN.</b></em></p>

### **Arrival at Woodlands Checkpoint or Tuas Checkpoint in Singapore**

Travellers should enter Singapore via the land checkpoint stated in their SHN waiver approval letter, and on the scheduled date and time. No refunds will be available for the COVID-19 PCR test if travellers fail to arrive within the approved entry date and checkpoint.

Upon arrival at the land checkpoints, Singapore Citizens and PRs holding Malaysia-issued PCA passes and valid approval for waiver of SHN will undergo passport, customs and security clearance, followed by a COVID-19 PCR test at the land checkpoints. Upon completion of the COVID-19 PCR test, the traveller should proceed directly to his/her declared place of residence, and remain isolated in his/her residence until a negative test result is conveyed to Him/Her. The traveller should not use public transport for travelling from the land checkpoints to the residence, with the exception of taxis/private hire vehicles and personal vehicles. The traveller should use dedicated taxi hotlines or ride-hail applications to hire the taxis and private hire cars, and should not flag down a taxi.

If the traveller tests positive for COVID-19, he/she will be given medical treatment accordingly. For Singapore Citizens and PRs who last departed Singapore before 27 March 2020 and are returning to Singapore, they will not be required to pay for the charges for COVID-19 treatment. For all other travellers, they will be responsible for charges for COVID-19 treatment if symptoms develop within 14 day of return, but Singapore Citizens and PRs may access Government subsidies and MediShield Life/Integrated Shield Plan to help pay for their bills. They should furnish the relevant supporting documents to indicate their status as a PCA traveler.

Travellers who do not apply for a SHN waiver will be subject to the prevailing public health measures for incoming travellers. Please refer to MOH’s website for information on the prevailing health measures for Singapore Citizens and PRs returning from abroad.
