<p style="font-size:16px; margin-top:10px; line-height:1.5;"><sup>1</sup>If the scheduled day of departure of the flight is D (e.g. 15 December 2021), the traveller must have only been to one or more of the <a href="/vtl/requirements-and-process#countries">VTL (Air) countries/regions</a>, Category I countries/regions (Hong Kong, Macao, Mainland China, Taiwan), and/or Singapore from D-14 to D (i.e. 1 December to 15 December 2021, if D is 14 December 2021).</p>

<p style="font-size:16px; margin-top:10px; line-height:1.5;"><sup>2</sup>If the pre-departure test is taken on 1 December 2021, it will be valid for departures up to 3 December 2021, 2359 hours.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px; margin-top:10px; line-height:1.5;"><sup>5</sup>The traveller’s day of departure from Singapore is defined as the scheduled day of departure of their flight or ferry, or the day they clear departure immigration if they depart by land.</p>
