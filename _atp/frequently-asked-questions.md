### Overview of the Air Travel Pass (ATP)

#### 1. What is an ATP?

An ATP allows visitors  travelling from one of the following countries/regions to seek entry into Singapore:
- Australia (excluding Victoria State)
- Brunei Darussalam
- Mainland China
- New Zealand

The ATP comes with conditions of travel that the applicant must comply with.

#### 2. How can visitors apply for an ATP?

To apply for an ATP, please go to <https://go.gov.sg/atpsg>. Do note that applications for the ATP must be made between seven and thirty calendar days prior to the intended date of entry into Singapore.

For example, visitors who intend to enter Singapore on 31 January 2021 must apply for an ATP between 1 January 2021 and 24 January 2021.

#### 3. How long will it take for an ATP application to be processed?

We will endeavour to get back to the applicant within three working days.

#### 4. Is there a fee to apply for an ATP?

No, there is no fee payable for the application of an ATP.

#### 5. Do visitors travelling with family members need to apply an ATP for every individual?

Yes, each visitor will require an ATP. In the case of a minor (below 18 years old), consent must be given by the parent or guardian for the application.

#### 6. Is there a limit to the number of times visitors can apply for an ATP?

There is no limit to the number of times visitors can apply for an ATP. Every entry into Singapore requires a new ATP application.

If submitting multiple ATP applications, visitors should ensure that the intended date of entry into Singapore for each application is at least 7 calendar days apart. This is because an ATP is valid from the visitor’s intended date of entry and up to 7 calendar days after. 

Otherwise, only the application with the latest intended date of entry will be processed and the rest rejected.

#### 7. How long is the validity of an ATP?
An ATP is valid for single entry into Singapore anytime from the visitor’s intended date of entry and up to seven calendar days after.

For example, visitors who hold a valid ATP to enter Singapore on 1 January 2021, have up to 8 January 2021 to do so should they need to make changes to their flight departure date.

#### 8. Once an ATP application is approved, can the relevant authorities change the conditions of travel or even cancel the ATP?

Given the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the relevant authorities in Singapore may introduce new measures or requirements as and when necessary to safeguard public health. 
This may result in changes to the conditions or cancellation of the ATP at short notice. Applicants will be notified of any such changes or cancellation of their ATP.

#### 9. Do Singapore Citizens / Permanent Residents / Long-Term Pass holders need to apply for an Air Travel Pass?

No, Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Long-Term Pass holders are not required to apply for an ATP. However, Long-Term Pass holders will still have to seek entry approval from the relevant Singapore Government agencies before travelling to Singapore.

For information on border control measures, please refer to ICA’s website <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg">here</a>.

#### 10. Can travel agents apply for Air Travel Pass on behalf of their clients?

No. Visitors will need to submit the application themselves as they are required to agree to the conditions of the ATP, read and agree to the Privacy Statement, as well as verify all submitted information.

#### 11. Why was my ATP application rejected?

An ATP application may be rejected for reasons such as:
- Incomplete and/or incorrect information submitted
- Duplicate applications
- Duplicate mobile number submitted <br/> <i>[Note: Each visitor must provide his/her own mobile number and remain contactable at that number throughout his/her stay in Singapore, with the exception of those below 18 years old.]</i>
- Multiple applications with intended dates of entry that are less than 7 days apart<br/>
<i>[Note: If submitting multiple ATP applications, visitors should ensure that the intended date of entry into Singapore for each application is at least 7 calendar days apart. This is because an ATP is valid from the visitor’s intended date of entry and up to 7 calendar days after.]</i>
- Invalid or ineligible flight number
- Passport validity is less than 6 months

#### 12. Can visitors use the ATP to transit/transfer through Singapore?

No, the ATP is for visitors who intend to enter Singapore and is not applicable for transfer/transit passengers. At this point in time, travellers will only be able to transfer through Singapore Changi Airport if they are travelling with an airline whose transfer routes have been approved by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS). Travellers should confirm with their airline on their eligibility to transfer.

<div id="requirements"></div>

### ATP Requirements for Entry into Singapore

#### 1. What are the ATP conditions of travel?

Visitors must comply with the ATP Conditions [here](/atp/conditions).

#### 2. Why must visitors take direct flights without transit to Singapore?

This is to protect public health in Singapore by ensuring that visitors are not travelling to Singapore via a country/region with high virus prevalence rates.

#### 3. What must visitors present to airline staff during check-in at the departure airport for Singapore?

When checking in at the departure airport, visitors must present the following to the airline staff:
- a valid ATP approval letter (electronic or physical copy) for the specified period of entry into Singapore;
- a valid visa (for visa-required visitors); and
- a mobile device with the TraceTogether app already downloaded and with their profiles registered on the app.

A visitor who does not have any of the above may be refused boarding by the airline.

Children who are aged 7 to 12 years in that calendar year, and those unable to use a mobile device due to a certified disability or special need, are eligible to be issued TraceTogether tokens with payment of a S$50 deposit (in lieu of the requirement to have a mobile device with the TraceTogether app downloaded) at the Changi Recommends booth at Changi Airport upon arrival in Singapore.

Children aged 6 years or younger in that calendar year are exempted from the TraceTogether requirement.

For visitors who do not have mobile devices to download the TraceTogether app or are unable to receive an SMS One-Time Password to register their profile on the TraceTogether app, please refer to Questions 5 and 6 under <a href="#contact">Contact Tracing – TraceTogether</a>.

#### 4. Do visitors need a return flight ticket to enter Singapore?

Visitors travelling on the ATP do not need a return flight ticket to enter Singapore. However, they are advised to check with the relevant authorities on the procedures and approval needed to return to their country/region of departure, or to enter their onward destination.

<div id="visa"></div>

### Visa Application

#### 1. Do visitors with a valid ATP need to apply separately for a visa to enter Singapore?

Visitors, who require a visa for travel to Singapore, must separately obtain a visa after receiving their ATP approval and before departing for Singapore.

If visitors have already been issued with visas that are still valid or if they are eligible for the visa-free transit facility, they do not need to apply for a visa.

Visitors may refer to ICA’s website [here](https://www.ica.gov.sg/visitor/visitor_entryvisa) for information on visa requirements and application.

#### 2. How long can visitors stay in Singapore?

Visitors who are granted entry into Singapore will be issued with a visit pass by the Singapore Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) at the immigration checkpoints. The duration of stay in Singapore will be generally aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Please note that the ATP is <b>not</b> an immigration visit pass. It only allows visitors to travel to and seek entry into Singapore within a specified period.

#### 3. Are visitors able to extend their duration of stay in Singapore?

All applications for extension of visit pass must be submitted online using ICA’s e-service [here](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/extend) at least seven days prior to the expiry of the visit pass to avoid overstaying. Each application will be considered on its own merits and there is no guarantee that an extension will be granted.

<div id="insurance"></div>

### Mandatory COVID-19 Travel Insurance Coverage

#### 1. Why is there a need for visitors to purchase COVID-19 travel insurance?

This is to ensure that short-term visitors are able to bear the full cost of medical treatment, tests and isolation imposed on them for public health reasons, should they be suspected of being infected with COVID-19, or require medical treatment for COVID-19 while in Singapore. Those who test positive for COVID-19 typically receive care in private hospitals.

#### 2. What is the minimum coverage for COVID-19 travel insurance?

Visitors must purchase travel insurance for the entire duration of their stay in Singapore, with a minimum coverage of S$30,000 for COVID-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs, prior to travel to Singapore. Should their COVID-19 treatment cost go beyond S$30,000, visitors will have to pay for the excess.

#### 3. How can visitors purchase the required insurance coverage?

Visitors must purchase COVID-19 travel insurance prior to their travel to Singapore. The SafeTravel website provides a [list of the Singapore-based insurers’ products](/health/travelinsurance). Visitors can visit the respective insurers’ websites to purchase the inbound insurance plan. They may reach out to the insurers for more information.

#### 4. Do visitors need to show proof of travel insurance purchase when they apply for the ATP?

Visitors will have to declare, at the point of ATP application, that they will purchase travel insurance, with a minimum coverage of S$30,000 for COVID-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs, prior to travel to Singapore. They must also carry with them an electronic or physical copy of their insurance policy to facilitate their entry into Singapore.

#### 5. What penalties will be imposed on traveller if he did not buy the insurance prior to entering Singapore?

Purchase of travel insurance is a condition of the Air Travel Pass. Non-compliance with any of the conditions of the Air Travel Pass may result in refusal of entry into Singapore and/or cancellation of the Air Travel Pass. In such an event, the Air Travel Pass holder may be liable for the cost of his/her repatriation, including custody and maintenance pending repatriation. Future Air Travel Pass applications may also be rejected.

<div id="pcrtest"></div>

### On-Arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Test

#### 1. Are visitors required to take an on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test?

Upon arrival in Singapore, visitors must undergo a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test at the airport, in lieu of a Stay-Home Notice. The test results will be out within 48 hours.

After taking the COVID-19 PCR test, visitors are to immediately take private transportation, taxi, or private hire car from the airport to their declared place of accommodation. They must remain isolated at the accommodation until the test result is confirmed to be negative. After being notified of their negative test results, visitors will be allowed to go about their activities in Singapore.

To expedite the COVID-19 PCR test at the airport, visitors should pre-book and make payment here.

#### 2. What types of transportation do visitors need to use when going from the airport to their declared place of accommodation, after taking the COVID-19 PCR test?

After taking the COVID-19 PCR test, visitors are to immediately take private transportation, taxi, or private hire car from the airport to their declared place of accommodation.

#### 3. Can visitors shop and eat at Changi Airport and visit Jewel Changi Airport upon arrival in Singapore?

No, visitors are not allowed to shop and eat at Changi Airport, including Jewel Changi Airport. This is because visitors are required to leave the airport immediately after their on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test, to isolate in their declared accommodation until the test result is confirmed to be negative. 

The only exception is for the procurement of goods and services in the airport transit area, before arrival immigration.

Visitors will only be allowed to go about their activities in Singapore after being notified of their negative test results.

#### 4. What types of accommodation do visitors need to use while waiting for their test results?

The accommodation must be non-residential and must be an individual room with an attached toilet. Empty residential premises are not allowed.

Visitors are required to bear the cost of their accommodation in Singapore.

Visitors may refer to the Singapore Hotel Association (SHA) [website](https://www.sha.org.sg/) for a list of hotels currently accepting visitors travelling to Singapore under the Green Lane or Air Travel Pass. The list is non-exhaustive and visitors may book other available accommodation as long as these are non-residential. Please note that visitors must stay in individual rooms with an attached toilet.

#### 5. Can visitors share the same room with family members / travel companions / a caretaker (due to a certified disability or special needs) while waiting for their PCR test results?

Yes, while waiting for their PCR test results, visitors are allowed to share the same room with their family members, travel companions or a caretaker, if they share similar travel history in the past 21 days prior to departure for Singapore.

Please also note that if the visitor’s test result is confirmed to be positive, all persons who had shared the same room with the visitor, as well as those identified to be a close contact, will be issued a Quarantine Order by the Singapore Ministry of Health (MOH).

#### 6. Do children need to undergo an on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test?

Children aged 6 or younger in that calendar year are not required to undergo an on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test. However, children whose close contacts are found to be tested positive for COVID-19 will be required to take the test.

#### 7. How much is the on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test at the airport?

The cost of the COVID-19 PCR test is S$160 (inclusive of Goods and Services Tax). Visitors will bear the cost of the test in Singapore.

To expedite the COVID-19 PCR test at the airport, visitors should pre-book and make payment [here](https://safetravel.changiairport.com/).

#### 7. What happens if visitors refuse to undergo the on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test?

If visitors refuse to undergo the on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test, they may be refused entry into Singapore and have their ATP cancelled. In such an event, visitors may also be liable for all costs incurred for their repatriation, including custody and maintenance pending repatriation.

#### 8. Can my company / family member / friend pick me up from the airport in a private vehicle and transport me to my declared place of accommodation where I will be waiting for my COVID-19 PCR test results?

Visitors entering Singapore on an approved Air Travel Pass may be picked up from the airport by their company / family member / friend in a private vehicle. There should not be more than one person picking the visitor up from the airport. 

Visitors must be transported directly to their declared place of accommodation to await their COVID-19 PCR test results. All persons in the private vehicle must wear face masks throughout the journey. The following precautionary measures are also strongly encouraged:
- The visitor should sit alone in the back seat and the front passenger seat should be left unoccupied.
- If more than one visitor is picked up, visitors sharing the same vehicle should have the same travel history and head to the same declared accommodation.
- The vehicle windows should be wound down and the air-conditioning turned off, where practical.
- After the visitor has been dropped off at his/her declared accommodation, the driver should wipe down the vehicle. Please refer to the National Environment Agency (NEA) guidelines for surface cleaning and disinfection.

<div id="contact"></div>

### Contact Tracing – TraceTogether

#### General FAQs on TraceTogether can be found [here](https://support.tracetogether.gov.sg/hc/en-sg).

#### 1. Must every visitor use TraceTogether?

Yes. All visitors to Singapore must download the TraceTogether app prior to their departure for Singapore. Upon arrival, visitors must activate and use the app (see questions 2 and 3 for app activation queries) for the duration of their stay in Singapore.

Children who are aged 7 to 12 years in that calendar year, and those unable to use a mobile device due to a certified disability or special need, are eligible to be issued TraceTogether tokens with payment of a S$50 deposit (in lieu of the requirement to have a mobile device with the TraceTogether app downloaded) at the Changi Recommends booth at Changi Airport or Seletar Business Aviation Centre at Seletar Airport upon arrival in Singapore. As each token is uniquely tagged to each individual, visitors are reminded to carry their own tokens with them wherever they go, and not exchange their tokens with others.

Children aged 6 years or younger in that calendar year are exempted from the TraceTogether requirement.

#### 2. After downloading the TraceTogether app, how do I activate it?

You can activate your app only after clearing Singapore immigration. There might be a short lag after clearing immigration before you can activate the app. 

After downloading the TraceTogether app, you need to follow the instructions that appear when you launch the app. You will need to verify your mobile number with an SMS One-Time Password and register your profile on the app with the same identification number, nationality and date of birth as those shown in the passport that you are using to enter Singapore. 

Please ensure that your TraceTogether App is updated to the latest version. You will see the Holding Screen after you have registered your profile. You must click on the ‘ACTIVATE APP’ button on the Holding Screen immediately after you have cleared arrival immigration in Singapore. Follow the instructions until you reach the Home Screen.

For more information, please refer to the TraceTogether website.

If you require assistance on how to download and activate the TraceTogether app, please email support@tracetogether.gov.sg.

#### 3. I have downloaded the TraceTogether app, but I cannot activate the app. What should I do?

Please check that your app has been updated to the latest version.

You can activate your app only <u>after</u> clearing Singapore immigration. There might be a short lag after clearing immigration before you can activate the app. 

If you still are unable to activate your app after immigration clearance, it could be because you did not register your profile with the same identification number, nationality and date of birth as those shown in the passport that you have used to enter Singapore. Follow the instructions to be navigated back to the Holding Screen.

You can edit your passport details by clicking the ‘edit’ button on the Holding Screen, as indicated below.

<img src="/images/TT_6.png" style="width:179px; height:318px;">

If you still face issues, please email <support@tracetogether.gov.sg> with your query and details of the issue you are facing, or call the support helpline at +65 6973 6511 during operating hours.

#### 4. If I change my mobile device or SIM card when I arrive in Singapore, do I need to download the TraceTogether app again?
If you change your mobile device, you are required to download the TraceTogether app again on your new mobile device and activate it by following the instructions that appear when you launch the app. You must also retain your previous mobile device with the TraceTogether app up to 21 days after departure from Singapore. This is because the TraceTogether app data stored in your previous mobile device also needs to be retained for that duration, as set out in the [ATP Condition 1(e)(ii)](/atp/conditions).

If you change your SIM card but are still using the same mobile device, you will not need to download the TraceTogether app again.

Please ensure that you keep your mobile device’s Bluetooth function turned on so that the TraceTogether app remains activated throughout your stay in Singapore.

#### 5. What happens if visitors do not have a mobile device to download the TraceTogether app?

All visitors must have a mobile device to download the TraceTogether app. They are responsible for ensuring that their mobile device is compatible with the TraceTogether app. The TraceTogether App can be downloaded from the [iOS Play Store](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/tracetogether/id1498276074) and [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.gov.tech.bluetrace) and Huawei App Gallery.

Visitors, with mobile devices that are unable to download the TraceTogether app, can rent a compatible mobile device from the Changi Recommends website [here](https://www.changirecommends.com/reservation_form.aspx) prior to departing for Singapore. They must have an electronic or physical copy of the booking confirmation from Changi Recommends to present to the airline staff during check-in at the departure airport. Visitors who are unable to present a booking confirmation may be refused boarding by the airline.

Visitors can pay for and collect their rental mobile device at the Changi Recommends booth in Changi Airport prior to clearing arrival immigration. Upon collection, they must download the TraceTogether app and immediately register their profile on the app with their Singapore mobile number and the same identification number, nationality and date of birth as those shown in the passport that you are using to enter Singapore. At immigration clearance, visitors are to present their mobile device with the TraceTogether app already downloaded and registered. Those who are unable to do so may be denied entry into Singapore by ICA.

Visitors, who have rented a mobile device from Changi Recommends, must carry it with them at all times during their stay in Singapore until it is returned to Changi Recommends. If you change to another mobile device during your stay in Singapore, you must download and activate the TraceTogether app on that device. You must also retain the app on that device for the rest of your stay and for 21 consecutive days after departing Singapore.

#### 6. What happens if visitors are unable to receive an SMS One-Time Password (OTP) to register their profile on the TraceTogether app?

Visitors who can download the TraceTogether app but are unable to obtain an SMS OTP to register their profile on the app due to network restrictions, can book a Singapore SIM card from the Changi Recommends website [here](https://www.changirecommends.com/reservation_form.aspx) prior to departing for Singapore. They must have an electronic or physical copy of the booking confirmation from Changi Recommends to present to the airline staff during check-in at the departure airport. Visitors who are unable to present a booking confirmation may be refused boarding by the airline.

Visitors can pay for and collect their Singapore SIM card at the Changi Recommends booth in Changi Airport prior to clearing arrival immigration. Upon collection, visitors are to activate the Singapore SIM card and immediately register their profile on the TraceTogether app with their Singapore mobile number and the same identification number, nationality and date of birth as those shown in the passport that you are using to enter Singapore. At immigration clearance, visitors are to present their mobile device with the TraceTogether app already downloaded and registered. Those who are unable to do so may be denied entry into Singapore by ICA.

#### 7. Can visitors switch off their mobile devices while in Singapore?

No, visitors must keep mobile devices and the Bluetooth function switched on at all times while in Singapore.

#### 8. Can visitors uninstall the TraceTogether app upon departing from Singapore?

Visitors must retain the TraceTogether app with the data on their mobile devices for 21 consecutive days after departing from Singapore. This is to facilitate contact tracing if visitors are tested positive for COVID-19.

#### 9. Where do visitors return their TraceTogether tokens?

Visitors must return their own TraceTogether tokens in-person at any of the following places: Changi Recommends booths at the Changi Airport Departure Hall, Seletar Business Aviation Centre at Seletar Airport, Woodlands Checkpoint, Tuas Checkpoint or Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal, prior to their departure from Singapore.

The S$50 deposit will be refunded if:
- the TraceTogether token the visitor is returning belongs to him/her; and
-	the visitor had made a deposit for the TraceTogether token being returned; and
- the TraceTogether token is not faulty or damaged.

The returned TraceTogether tokens will be securely stored for 21 days from the day of collection, and the data in the tokens will be uploaded upon request by the Singapore Ministry of Health, should the visitor test positive for COVID-19 while in Singapore or in the first 21 days after leaving Singapore.
