### **Application**

#### 1. Who is eligible to apply to travel to Singapore under the RGL? 

Persons of all nationalities who are legally resident in Japan and who need to make single-entry, short-term essential travel for business or official purposes between Singapore and Japan.

#### 2. I am a Singapore Citizen / Singapore Permanent Resident / Singapore Long-Term Pass holder* who is resident in Japan. Am I eligible to apply for the RGL?

Yes. All residents in Japan who need to make short-term essential business or official travel between Singapore and Japan are eligible to apply for the RGL.

<p style="font-size: 1.0rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">* <em>Singapore Long-Term Pass holders who are eligible to apply for RGL travel include holders of MOM-issued work passes (e.g. Employment Pass, EntrePass, Personalised Employment Pass, S Pass, Work Permit, Dependant’s Pass) and holders of the ICA-issued Long-Term Visit Pass.</em></p>

#### 3. What is a SafeTravel Pass?

A SafeTravel Pass is required to seek entry into Singapore under the RGL. It is non-transferable and will be valid for a single entry into Singapore. Travellers must enter Singapore within this stipulated week (0000hrs Monday to 2359hrs Sunday), and can stay in Singapore for the duration of their Visit Pass issued at the immigration checkpoint in Singapore. 

SafeTravel Passes will be issued on a limited basis in order to manage the risk of imported COVID-19 cases.

Please send an email to <COVID_SafeTravelEnquiries@mti.gov.sg> if you have further queries related to the SafeTravel Pass.

#### 4. How do residents in Japan apply to travel to Singapore under the RGL? What are the steps from the time I put in an application to the time I obtain a visa? How long is the processing time? What documents do I need to submit?

Residents in Japan seeking to travel to Singapore via the RGL must be hosted by a company or a government agency in Singapore. The host company can file the application for a SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller either directly at <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO>, or through a sponsoring government agency.<sup>1</sup>

When applying for the SafeTravel Pass, Proof of Residency in Japan is required. Japanese nationals should present a copy of their passport page, while foreign residents in Japan should present a copy of their Residence Cards. The applicant will also be required to submit the controlled itinerary for the traveller(s)’ first 14 days of stay in Singapore, which is limited to travel between places of business and accommodation, with limited contact with the community.

The application for the SafeTravel Pass will be open 2 to 5 weeks before the week of the traveller’s planned departure. The processing of the application can take up to 7 days (excluding the day of application). You are encouraged to apply for the SafeTravel Pass as early as possible, factoring in the time necessary for the processing of the SafeTravel Pass application, visa application (if needed) and taking a pre-departure COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test before departure to Singapore.

When the SafeTravel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be issued to the sponsoring company / government agency by email. With this letter, an approved applicant who is a visa-required passport holder will proceed to apply for a visa for travel to Singapore through the usual channels (Singapore overseas missions, authorised visa agents, local contact or companies) at least 4 working days before departure. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status [here](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save).

Those who did not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will not need to apply for a visa for RGL travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

The approved applicant will have to submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations as well as declare his/her accommodation electronically via the SG Arrival Card, within 3 days prior to the date of arrival in Singapore.

Prior to the traveller’s departure from Japan, the sponsoring company or government agency should submit the traveller’s **certificate of negative result for COVID-19 PCR test** taken within 72 hours before departure and **latest** controlled itinerary in Singapore at <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO>.

The traveller is required to present his/her valid SafeTravel Pass, certificate of negative result for a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test which should be in English or accompanied by an English translation, return air ticket or proof of other transportation arrangements to depart Singapore, and valid visa (for visa-required passport holders) for pre-boarding checks at the airlines check-in counter and immigration counter. Otherwise, he/she may be refused boarding.

#### 5.	What are the responsibilities of the host company?

When a company applies for the SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller, it is also responsible for the timely submission of the accompanying documents.

The host company should also ensure that the traveller abides by the terms and conditions of the Singapore-Japan RGL, and the prevailing health measures during his/her stay in Singapore. Authorities may ask for proof of adherence to the controlled itinerary, including physical verification or SafeEntry Pass records (e.g. screenshots), and other terms and conditions when the traveller is in Singapore.

You can access the terms and conditions of the Singapore-Japan RGL at <https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/japan/rgl/terms-and-conditions>. Action will be taken against the traveller and the host company in the event of non-compliance.

#### 6. Can tourists apply for SafeTravel Passes?

SafeTravel Passes are only issued to travellers making short-term essential business and official travel. These passes are not applicable for tourists.

#### 7. Can my SafeTravel Pass be transferred to my family member, friend, colleague or business partner?

SafeTravel Passes are not transferable to others.

#### 8.	Do I need to pay to apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

No payment is required.

#### 9. Is there a limit to the number of times I can apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

There is no limit to the number of times a traveller can apply for a SafeTravel Pass.  Every entry to Singapore requires a new SafeTravel Pass application. However, please note that there may be penalties for repeated non-utilisation.

#### 10. What visa will I be eligible for under the RGL, and what is the duration of stay that I will be eligible for in Singapore? 

Every application for a visa, including the type of visa granted, will be considered on its own merits and subject to approval. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/ she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status through <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save>.

Those who did not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will not need to apply for a visa for RGL travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

Travellers who are granted entry into Singapore are generally issued with a Visit Pass, of which the duration would be aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### 11. How can I further extend my Visit Pass / stay when I am in Singapore, if necessary? 

All applications for extension of Visit Pass must be submitted online using ICA’s e-Service (<https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/extend>) at least seven days prior to the expiry of the Visit Pass to avoid overstaying. Extension of Visit Pass will not be accepted over the counter. Each application is considered on its own merits.

#### 12. My travel plans have changed/ some information in my application is incorrect. How can I amend the details of my SafeTravel Pass application/ approved SafeTravel Pass?

Both the SafeTravel Pass application and issued SafeTravel Pass cannot be amended. Please ensure that all details of the application form are accurate at the point of submission.

#### 13. What if I have changes to my controlled itinerary? 

The host company should be responsible for promptly monitoring and reporting any deviation in your controlled itinerary. The host company should email the updated controlled itinerary on behalf of the traveller to <COVID_SafeTravelEnquiries@mti.gov.sg>. Please include the approved STP reference number and documents on hand for submission, and ensure that the amendments or deviation from the controlled itinerary are in accordance with the stipulated guidelines. A non-compliant controlled itinerary may result in the withdrawal of the STP and termination of the Visit Pass if not immediately rectified.

#### 14. Can the sponsoring company / agency or traveller check the status of the SafeTravel Pass application?

The sponsoring company/agency or traveller may make enquiries about the status of their application(s) via <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO>. Please prepare the traveller’s identification details and intended date of entry in Singapore as declared in the STP application.  

#### 15. Why was my application rejected?

SafeTravel Pass applications may be rejected for reasons, including the following:

- Inadequate justifications provided for reason of travel.
- Non-compliant controlled itinerary submitted.
- Wrong proof of residency submitted.
- Quota limit reached for intended week of entry.
 
#### 16. Can I use the RGL to come to Singapore for long-term work?

Note that all Short-Term Pass holders will be accorded the necessary medical treatment at their cost.

### **Health Measures in Singapore**

#### 22.	What health measures will I be subjected to upon arrival in Singapore? 

RGL travellers from Japan must take a PCR test after arrival in Singapore, and remain isolated in a declared self-sourced accommodation until their test results are released (typically within 48 hours)<sup>2</sup>. Transportation from the airport to the declared accommodation will have to be provided by the host company or government agency subject to prevailing health measures<sup>3</sup>. Travellers will bear the costs of the post-arrival PCR test in Singapore and stay in the declared accommodation.

If the result indicates that the traveller has tested negative for COVID-19, the host company or government agency will ensure that the traveller is transported directly from the declared accommodation to the workplace and back according to the submitted controlled itinerary for the first 14 days of the traveller’s stay in Singapore. The traveller may not use public transportation for this purpose, with the exception of private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport<sup>4</sup>.

Travellers to Singapore must use the TraceTogether app and SafeEntry<sup>5</sup>, take their temperature twice daily, report their health status to the host company or government agency, and adhere to prevailing public health requirements for the duration of their stay in Singapore.

#### 23. What is the TraceTogether app? Does the Singapore Government track my movements via the app? 

The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s phone, and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data. 

The app works best on phones with Android version 5.1 and above. More information on the app can be found at <https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg>.

#### 24. What is SafeEntry?

SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that logs the NRIC/FINs and mobile numbers of individuals visiting hotspots, workplaces of essential services, as well as selected public venues to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 through activities such as contact tracing and identification of COVID-19 clusters. 

An existing check-in method is via scanning of a QR code at the venue with a camera phone or a QR scanner app. Hence, you are encouraged to purchase a Singapore local data SIM card, or connect your mobile phone to a Singapore local Wi-Fi network to access the form for this mode of check-in. 
 
Alternatively, some venues allow you to complete SafeEntry by presenting your passport as identification. Establishments will assist visitors with manual SafeEntry check-in.

More information can be found at <https://www.safeentry.gov.sg>.

### **Returning to Japan**

#### 25.	Do I need to be tested again in Singapore before I return to Japan? Do I need to be quarantined or be tested again upon return to Japan?

According to the Government of Japan, RGL returnees to Japan are required to take a pre-departure COVID 19 PCR test in Singapore within 72 hours of their return to Japan. They may be exempted from this requirement if they are Japanese nationals and (a) the duration of their stay in Singapore does not exceed 15 days, or (b) if they agree to serve a 14-day quarantine upon their return to Japan.

Travellers who miss the Cut-off Test Timing will <u>not</u> be able to obtain a test result in time for their flight.  

Please make arrangements early for your test slot so that you can qualify for the RGL arrangements.

##### 8. What happens if the clinic assesses that I am unable to receive the PCR test for unforeseen circumstances? 

If you are unable to receive the test, you may wish to reschedule your flight, if you still wish to tap on the RGL arrangement.  

##### Test Results

##### 9.	When can I expect to get my PCR test results?

You will receive your PCR test results and memo at least three hours before your flight. 

The clinic will email the results to your email address. You will need to print and bring the memo overseas yourself.
