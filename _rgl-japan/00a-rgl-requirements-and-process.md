On 11 September 2020, Singapore and Japan agreed to implement the Reciprocal Green Lane (Business Track) to facilitate essential short-term business and official travel between both countries. 

The Singapore-Japan Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL) is applicable to all residents in Singapore and Japan entering/exiting through Tokyo (Narita International Airport or Haneda International Airport) or Osaka (Kansai International Airport).

The SafeTravel Pass is a mandatory document for in-bound travellers seeking to make essential business and official travel from Japan to Singapore under the Singapore-Japan RGL.

### **Application**

Business or official travellers seeking to travel via the RGL to Singapore must be sponsored<sup>1</sup> by either a Singapore-based company or a Singapore Government agency, which will file an application on behalf of the applicant for a SafeTravel Pass.

IMPORTANT

Travellers (who are not Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents or Long-Term Pass holders) without a valid SafeTravel Pass will be refused entry into Singapore.
For more information on the Terms and Conditions of the SafeTravel Pass, please [click here](/japan/rgl/terms-and-conditions).

## **Process Overview**

### **Before entering Singapore**

#### Visa Requirements

When the SafeTravel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be issued to the sponsoring company or government agency.  

With the SafeTravel Pass approval, an approved applicant who is a visa-required passport holder can proceed to apply for a visa for travel to Singapore through the usual channels.  If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/she need not apply for a new visa.  The applicant can check his/her visa status through [this page](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save). 

**Those who do not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will not need to apply for a visa for Green/Fast Lane travel.** Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.  

The approved applicant will have to electronically submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations and declare his/her accommodation in Singapore via the [SG Arrival Card](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/), before departing for Singapore. The SG Arrival Card can also be accessed via the [Visit Singapore Travel Guide App](https://www.visitsingapore.com/travel-guide-tips/visit-singapore-travel-guide-app/).

#### Pre-Departure Measures

Prior to travelling to Singapore, approved SafeTravel Pass travellers must: 

- Monitor their health status and defer travel if feeling unwell;
- Have not travelled out of Japan in the entirety of the 14 days prior to departure;
- Take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 72 hours from departure and obtain a certificate of having tested negative for COVID-19, at the traveller’s own cost. The certificate must be issued by medical institutions designated by the Government of Japan. 

Travellers are also strongly encouraged to [register and pre-pay](https://safetravel.changiairport.com/#/) for their post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test prior to departing for Singapore. 

In the event that the visitor is unable to payment before departing to Singapore, please ensure that he/she has a mobile phone with an activated line upon arrival, as on-site payment would typically require an OTP being sent to the phone.

At pre-boarding checks, approved SafeTravel Pass travellers must produce:

-	A valid SafeTravel Pass for the intended week of travel; 
-	A valid visa to enter Singapore (for visa-required passport holders);
-	A valid certificate of negative result for a COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours before departure for Singapore; 
-	A return air ticket or proof of other transportation arrangements (e.g. private transportation) to depart Singapore.

Travellers who do not produce the documents above at pre-boarding or immigration checks can be refused boarding.

### **Arrival and Stay in Singapore**

#### Post-Arrival Measures

The SafeTravel Pass traveller will undergo a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival in Singapore at his/her own cost. 

At arrival immigration, approved SafeTravel Pass travellers should declare he/she is a SafeTravel Pass holder, and must produce:

-	A valid SafeTravel Pass for the intended week of travel;
-	A valid visa to enter Singapore (for visa-required passport holders);
-	A valid certificate of negative result for a COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours before departure for Singapore; and
-	A return air ticket or proof of other transportation arrangements (e.g. private transportation) to depart Singapore.

Applicants without these documents can be refused entry into Singapore under the RGL arrangement. 

The host<sup>2</sup> company or government agency will transport the traveller directly from the airport to the declared self-sourced accommodation, adhering to prevailing health measures.  The traveller must remain in the declared accommodation (non-residential address only) until the test result is released.

If the result indicates that the traveller has tested negative for COVID-19, the traveller can proceed on the pre-declared controlled itinerary. If tested positive for COVID-19, the traveller will undergo medical treatment at his/her cost.

#### Measures during stay in Singapore

SafeTravel Pass travellers to Singapore must subscribe to the relevant contact tracing mobile applications and technology solutions that are in place at the time of travel, including TraceTogether and SafeEntry for the entire duration of their stay in Singapore. A traveller who does not have a TraceTogether-compatible device should be provided with one by his/her host, for the duration of his/her stay in Singapore. If the traveller subsequently tests positive for COVID-19 while in Singapore or within 14 days after departure from Singapore, he/she will be required to upload his/her TraceTogether data.

In addition to abiding by prevailing local public health and safety distancing measures, SafeTravel Pass travellers must adhere to a controlled itinerary that is supervised by the host company or government agency for the first 14 days.  The traveller is prohibited from using public transportation for this purpose, with the exception of private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport.
