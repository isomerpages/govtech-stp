<b><span style="color:red; font-size:20px;">NOTICE FOR RGL TRAVELLERS FROM INDONESIA</span> </b> <br/>
<span style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.0; color:red;">On 28 December 2020, Indonesia announced a temporary ban on the entry of all foreign nationals into Indonesia. The Indonesian government has notified MFA that this ban would also apply to foreign nationals travelling to Indonesia under all of Indonesia’s Travel Corridor Arrangements (TCA) with other countries. Hence, Singapore residents would not be able to travel from Singapore to Indonesia under the Singapore-Indonesia Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL) / TCA. Given the reciprocal nature of this travel arrangement, <u>travellers will also not be able to apply to travel from Indonesia to Singapore under the Singapore-Indonesia RGL / TCA</u>. Travellers who have already received approval to enter Singapore under the Singapore-Indonesia RGL / TCA can continue to do so.

<b><span style="color:red; font-size:20px;">NOTICE FOR RGL TRAVELLERS FROM JAPAN</span> </b> <br/>
<span style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.0; color:red;">On 26 December 2020, Japan announced a temporary ban on the entry of all non-resident foreign nationals into Japan from 28 December 2020 to 31 January 2021. The Japanese government has since announced that all of Japan’s Business Track  arrangements with other countries, including the Singapore-Japan Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL), will be suspended from 14 January 2021 until the State of Emergency in Japan is lifted. Given the reciprocal nature of the Singapore-Japan RGL and Residence Track, <u>travellers will not be able to apply to travel from Japan to Singapore under the RGL during this period</u>. Travellers who have already received approval to enter Singapore under the RGL can continue to do so but should check with the Japanese Embassy in Singapore with regard to the latest immigration regulations for their return to Japan. Please refer to the MFA statement <a href="https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-Statements-Transcripts-and-Photos/2021/01/20210115-SG-JP-RGL-Suspension">here</a> for more details.
