Most travellers do not need to serve an SHN, unless they are not fully vaccinated with WHO EUL vaccines. If you need information on entry requirements when travelling to Singapore, or are unsure whether you need to serve an SHN, please start from the <a href="/arriving/overview" target="_blank">Travelling to Singapore</a> page instead to find out more.

### SHN Requirements

The Stay-Home Notice (SHN) is a legal notice issued under the Infectious Diseases Act that requires travellers to remain in their place of residence or <a href="#sdf">SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF)</a> for a stipulated period. The failure to comply with any SHN requirement is punishable under Singapore laws and can amount to an imprisonment term and/or fine. Additional penalties such as the cancellation of long-term visit passes could also be taken against errant individuals by the relevant authorities.

In general, travellers under SHN are required to take a mandatory COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR Test”) towards the end of their SHN. <b>Travellers can check their required SHN duration and required COVID-19 tests on the individual <a href="/arriving/overview" target="_blank">SafeTravel Lanes pages</a></b>. Travellers approved for entry into Singapore should refer to their Entry Approval Letter or SafeTravel Pass for details on whether they are required to serve their SHN and COVID-19 test to take.

Travellers issued with an SHN should refer to the conditions inside the SHN, and watch the video below for a quick overview of SHN requirements. Travellers who have questions regarding their SHN may also refer to the <a href="/faq#shnsdf" target="_blank">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section</a> . Those in need of additional support can refer to <a href="https://www.gov.sg/article/call-these-helplines-if-you-need-emotional-or-psychological-support" target="_blank">this page</a> for a list of local helplines and resources.

### SHN Dedicated Facilities (SDF)

Travellers arriving from Restricted Category countries/regions are required by default to serve their SHN at an SDF. Due to the fast-changing demands for SDFs, <b>travellers will be assigned to an available SDF only upon arrival</b>. <!--Travellers who wish to book an SDF suite at a specific hotel at higher cost, may click <a href="/health/shn/sdfupgrade">here</a> to find out more.-->

The cost of a 7-day SDF stay is typically S$1,015 per person per room. A further breakdown is provided in the table below*. The exact costs for the SDF stay will be made known to travellers during the entry approval application process for pass holders, or during check-in at the SDF for Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents. Travellers who fail to pay for the SDF cost may be charged interest for late payments. Please refer to the <a href="/faq#shnsdf">FAQs</a> for more information.

### Specific Requests for SDF Stay

Travellers who have specific needs for their SDF stay (e.g. smoking rooms, child-friendly amenities), or wish to request to serve their SHN at a place of residence due to medical requirements, may wish to refer to [this self-help form](https://go.gov.sg/shnhotelneeds) for details. Alternatively, they may contact the SafeTravel Enquiries helpline at 6812 5555 for assistance. Travellers are strongly advised to submit their enquiry or request <u>two weeks in advance</u> of their arrival as border measures may be adjusted due to the fluidity of the Covid-19 situation. 

Travellers who are already serving SHN at an SDF with special requests should contact the SDF's front desk for assistance.

<p>As there is a very high volume of SDF-related requests, please write in early and we seek your understanding and patience that it may take up to five working days to receive a response.</p>

<div id="date"></div>

### SHN Start and End Date

SHN will begin <b>immediately</b> from the time the notice is issued on the day of the traveller's arrival in Singapore. It will remain in effect until the traveller is notified of a negative test result from the final PCR test taken at the end of the SHN. 

Travellers serving their SHN at a place of residence or self-sourced accommodation will be scheduled to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction ("PCR Test") before the end of the SHN. Travellers who do not receive their test appointment details a day before the end of their SHN should seek assistance in writing via <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry" target="_blank">this form</a>. Travellers may end their SHN arrangements upon receipt of a negative test result or when they complete the 7-day SHN period applicable to them, whichever is later. 

For travellers serving SHN in an SDF, <b>the SDF will inform the traveller of the check-out time after it receives confirmation of the negative COVID-19 test result from the relevant government agency</b>. Travellers will only be allowed to leave the SDF thereafter. 

An example of how to determine SHN duration can be found below. You may also <a href="/shn-calculator" target="_blank">use this SHN Calculator</a> to calculate the estimated end date of your SHN.

### SHN Compliance Checks

Travellers issued with the Stay-Home Notice (SHN) will be subjected to on-site or electronic compliance checks (SMS, phone/video calls) from the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA), Ministry of Manpower (MOM) or Ministry of Education (MOE). Travellers should note that officers conducting house visits will produce their warrant cards or authorisation letters as proof of identity. For phone/video compliance checks, travellers will only be asked to provide the last four digits of his/her Identity Card or Travel Document for verification. Any payment request made by the caller may be a scam. Travellers with SHN issues may call the SafeTravel Helpline at 6812 5555 for further enquiries or assistance.
