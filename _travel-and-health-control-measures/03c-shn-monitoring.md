The Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) and Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will issue an Electronic Monitoring Device (“device”) to travellers above 12 and are serving their Stay-Home Notice (SHN) outside the SHN-Dedicated Facility (SDF). It is used solely to detect travellers that have wilfully left their SHN accommodation before the specified period. 

Your personal privacy is protected while using these devices. The device does not have any audio or video recording capabilities. All location data is transmitted via end-to-end encryption and can only be accessed by authorised government officials for investigation.

      <td style="font-size:20px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;">ICA’s wristband device, also used by MOE for foreign students, uses an app (StayHome@SG) and a “gateway” device that must be plugged into a power socket at the place of residence. It uses Bluetooth signals and alerts the authorities if the distance between the wristband and gateway at home is beyond a pre-defined range but cannot relay the exact current location of its wearer. You may wish to refer to the User Setup Guide <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/covid-19/stayhomesg-user-setup-guide.pdf">here</a> and Frequently Asked Questions on the StayHome@SG app <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/covid-19/stay@homesg-faqs.pdf">here</a>. <br/><br/>

      <td style="font-size:20px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;">MOM’s smartwatch device uses GPS and 4G technology to track the wearer’s current location, as well as geo-fence him/ her at the SHN’s residences. It also has other features, including a sensor that will trigger alert should the wearer tampers or removes the smartwatch.
