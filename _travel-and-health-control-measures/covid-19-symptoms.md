On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organisation declared the rapid transmission of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. COVID-19 belongs to a large family of viruses known to cause mild to severe respiratory issues. Studies conducted have consistently found that COVID-19 is transmitted primarily through respiratory droplets expelled by an infected individual.

According to the WHO, about 15% of all COVID-19 patients would go on to develop severe health complications, potentially leading to death. As such, travellers who are experiencing/showing any combination of the following symptoms, should defer their travel plans and seek immediate medical attention:

-	Fever (body temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius or higher)
-	Cough
-	Fatigue
-	Loss of taste or smell
-	Nasal congestion
-	Conjunctivitis (also known as red eyes)
-	Sore throat
-	Headache
-	Muscle or joint pains
-	Skin rash
-	Nausea or vomiting
-	Diarrhoea
-	Chills
-	Dizziness
