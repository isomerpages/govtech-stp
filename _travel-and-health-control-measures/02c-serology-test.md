### Serology Test

Unlike the COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”) which detects active COVID-19 infections, a serological test detects antibodies for COVID-19 from a past COVID-19 infection. Subject to further assessment, travellers with a history of infection from COVID-19 may be  required to undergo serology tests on arrival in Singapore to confirm their recovered status. The cost of the tests would be borne by the travellers.

A serological test entails the taking of a blood sample from an individual to test for the presence of antibodies produced in the human body to fight an infection. In general, individuals are likely to test positive for their serological test if they had contracted COVID-19 more than 10 to 14 days before the test.
