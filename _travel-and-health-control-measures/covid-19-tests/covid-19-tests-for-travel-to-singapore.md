### COVID-19 Tests for Travel to Singapore

This page provides information on the various COVID-19 tests to be taken when travelling to Singapore. All inbound travellers aged 7 and above, including those who had recovered from COVID-19, will be tested.

The health measures to be imposed may not be limited to COVID-19 tests, and you should check the requirements of your respective <a href="/arriving/overview">Safe Travel Lane</a> for full details.


#### 1. PCR Test before Departing to Singapore

Depending on the travellers’ travel history and [Safe Travel Lane](/arriving/overview) used to visit Singapore, travellers may be required to take a PCR test within 72 hours <u>before</u> departing to Singapore. To test for COVID-19, travellers bound for Singapore are required to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”) at an [internationally accredited or recognised lab/clinic/medical facility](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/accreditation-bodies-for-covid-19-testing). Travellers should request for a copy of the PCR test result as it will be considered by the airlines and ferry terminal operators as proof that the traveller has been tested for COVID-19. The documentary proof should be in English and should also state the date of the test taken, traveller’s name as well as date of birth or passport number (per the passport used for travelling). Travellers who fail to produce the required documentary proof of a valid negative pre-departure PCR test may be denied boarding or turned away.

#### 2. On-Arrival Tests

All travellers will be tested for COVID-19 upon arrival in Singapore. The cost of the tests taken in Singapore is reflected below, and travellers are advised to <u>register and pay for the tests before their arrival</u> to shorten the relevant administrative processes.
