## Stay Home Notice (SHN) and Dedicated SHN Facility

#### 1. Am I required to serve a Stay-Home Notice (SHN)? How long is the SHN?

Each Safe Travel Lane will have different requirements for SHN or have no SHN requirement. Please refer to the requirements of each Safe Travel Lane via the arrival overview page [here](https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/arriving/overview), or via the Safe Travel Lanes dropdown list at the top navigation bar of the SafeTravel website.

#### 2. Can I choose to serve my Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at a dedicated SHN facility if I do not have a suitable place of residence?

**Singapore Citizens/ Permanent Residents**

Singapore citizens and permanent residents who do not have a suitable residence to serve their SHN in may appeal to serve their SHN at a dedicated SHN facility through the link go.gov.sg/shnhotelneeds. All requests will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

**Long-Term Pass Holder**

Long-Term Pass Holders will have to secure a suitable accommodation to serve their SHN in prior to their arrival in Singapore.

#### 3. Do I have to pay for my stay at a dedicated Stay-Home Notice (SHN) facility if I request to opt-in?

From 1 Jan 2021, costs of stay at dedicated SHN facilities for SCs and PRs will no longer be waived. Click [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/updates-to-stay-home-notice-and-charging-policy-for-travellers) for more details.

#### 4. I am returning from a country/place which is eligible to opt to serve the 14-day SHN at a suitable place but transiting through a country/place which required a 14-day SHN at a dedicated facility. What SHN measure would apply?

#### 11. Can I request to opt-out of serving SHN at the SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF)?

<u><b>Extenuating Reasons</b></u>

If you are granted approval to serve SHN at your residence due to extenuating circumstances, your family members, if any, may continue to live in the same residence. However, you and your family should avoid contact with each other and observe good personal hygiene practices. For their safety, you should stay in your room as much as possible and use a dedicated toilet if possible. If you are living with a vulnerable person (e.g. senior citizen etc) even if the person is a family member, consider alternative accommodation for yourself or the vulnerable person.

If you are sharing a house with non-family members, stay in your own room as much as possible and use a dedicated toilet if possible.

- Returning Singaporeans or Permanent Residents may submit an application to opt-out via <https://go.gov.sg/shnhotelneeds>. 
- Short-term visitors and ICA-issued Long-Term Visit Pass Holders may submit an application to ICA_nCOV_Request@ica.gov.sg.

<u><b>Non-Extenuating Reasons</b></u>

If you are arriving from select countries/regions and are able to meet the criteria* below, you may opt-out of dedicated SHN facilities and serve SHN at your place of residence. Please refer to this [table](/files/SHN-and-swab-summary.pdf) for the list of eligible countries/regions and the criteria for opt-out. 

* Your residence would be suitable for SHN if you:

- Are occupying the place of residence (i.e. residential address) alone, or only with household members with the same travel history, who are also serving their SHN of the same duration and period; and
- There is no one ordinarily residing at the place of residence (e.g. domestic helper) who does not share the same travel history, and you have already made all necessary arrangements to ensure that any such person will not reside at the place of residence until the conclusion of the SHN period.

<u><b>Application for Opt-Out due to Non-Extenuating Reasons</b></u>
- Returning Singaporeans or Permanent Residents may submit an application to opt-out via <https://go.gov.sg/shnhotelneeds>.

## COVID-19 PCR Test

#### 1. I have an upcoming flight to Singapore. When must my pre-departure test be taken before the flight to be accepted for arrival in Singapore? What kind of COVID-19 tests will be accepted?

Singapore only accepts test results from labs in the country that are [internationally accredited or recognised](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/accreditation-bodies-for-covid-19-testing) by the respective Government. The test result memo must state the negative test result in English, date that the test was taken, traveller/s name and either Date of Birth or Passport Number as stated in the passport, If the personal details used are not stated in the passport, the traveller should have the relevant identity document on hand for verification.

Inbound travellers, who are not Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents and who are required to serve a 14-day SHN, must take a COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours before departure in order to enter Singapore.

<u><b>Direct flight</b></u>

For travellers who take a direct flight, the 72 hours will be counted from the departure of the flight to Singapore.

<u><b>Connecting flights</b></u>

For travellers who have to take a connecting flight(s), the 72 hours will be counted from the departure of the first leg only and the total transit duration for the trip must not be more than 24 hours. If the total transit duration is more than 24 hours, a PDT must be taken within 72 hours from the last leg (i.e. the flight to Singapore).

For negative test result requirements, please note that Singapore only accepts test results from labs in the country that are internationally accredited or recognised by the respective Government. The test result memo must state:
- Negative test result in English,
- Date that the test was taken,
- Traveller/s name and either Date of Birth or Passport Number as stated in the passport 

If the personal details used are not stated in the passport the traveller should have the relevant identity document on hand for verification.
Travellers on stipulated COVID-19 travel channels (e.g. Green/Fast Lane arrangements are required to comply with prevailing border health conditions stipulated as part of their entry permits

#### 2. I am [transiting via Singapore](https://www.caas.gov.sg/covid-19-updates/updates/Publication/travellers-to-be-allowed-to-transit-through-changi-airport-from-2-june-2020). Do I still need to take a PDT and present a valid negative COVID-19 test result?

At this point in time, travellers will only be able to transit through Singapore Changi Airport if they are travelling with an airline whose transfer route has been approved. Travellers are encouraged to confirm with their airlines on their eligibility to travel.

Currently, only travellers from India / Indonesia / the Philippines who are transiting through Singapore (i.e. India via Singapore to destination country) will have to present a valid negative COVID-19 test result.

#### 3. Are returning travellers to Singapore on the Reciprocal Green Lane (RGLs) subjected to the PDT before return to Singapore?

There are currently no requirements for RGL travellers to take another COVID-19 PCR test before returning to Singapore.

Please click [here](/rgl/returning) to find out more on the Reciprocal Green Lane arrangements.

#### 4. What will happen if I arrive in Singapore and do not have a valid negative PCR test certificate?

Travellers (who are not Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents) from countries where a valid negative COVID-19 test result is required as a condition for entry into Singapore, but are unable to produce a valid negative COVID-19 test result, will be denied entry into Singapore.

Airlines, Charterers and Air Operators for any flights to Singapore must conduct checks to ensure that passengers meet the requirement before they are allowed for boarding. Air operators will be responsible to repatriate any passenger rejected at the checkpoint.

If passengers are found to have produced false/forged COVID-19 test certificates, it will affect their ability to obtain or sponsor immigration facilities in the future.

#### 5. I was recently diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. When can I travel into Singapore?

You should schedule your travel into Singapore at least 21 days after your date of COVID-19 diagnosis, based on your first positive PCR test. For example, if the date of your swab which yielded your first positive PCR test is on 1 Nov (Day 1), you should only depart for Singapore on 22 Nov (Day 22) and onwards. You should not travel if feeling unwell.

Travellers with a recent diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in the past 21 days will be denied boarding on flights bound for Singapore.

#### 6. I have recovered from COVID-19, am I required to undergo a pre-departure test (PDT) before entry into Singapore? Will I be denied entry into Singapore?

Travellers with a recent diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in the past 21 days will be denied boarding on flights bound for Singapore. Travellers should schedule your travel into Singapore at least 21 days after the date of your first positive COVID-19 PCR test.

*E.g. Date of first positive PCR test received on 1 Nov (Day 1) — Departure from Singapore should only be from 22 Nov (Day 22) onwards*

You are still required to take a COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours before departure to Singapore.

If the pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test result is positive, recovered individuals must also submit documentary proof of his/her past diagnosis of COVID-19, based on his/her first ever positive PCR test result. The date of the first ever positive PCR test result must be between 22 to 180 days prior to the date of arrival in Singapore.

#### 7. How will I know my COVID-19 test result?

All travellers would be informed of their swab test results verbally by phone or in person. For travellers who have a Singpass account, they can login to the HealthHub [website](https://www.healthhub.sg/myhealth) to access their swab test results once available. No other hardcopy or softcopy report would be issued.

#### 8. How do I request a refund for my COVID-19 test.

Please note that once your entry application is approved, there will be no refunds of the payment made even if you do not enter Singapore as planned, unless there are extenuating reasons (eg. trip cancellation due to passing of next-of-kin etc). 
- For **ICA Long Term Pass Holders, Singapore Citizens and PRs**, you may write in to <ICA_nCOV_Request@ica.gov.sg>, stating the reasons for the refund request. 
- For **Work Pass Holders under Periodic Commuting Arrangement**, please write in to <COVID_SafeTravelEnquiries@mti.gov.sg>
- For **Work Pass Holders in general**, please write in to <https://service2.mom.gov.sg/efeedback/Forms/eFeedback.asp>.
- For **Student’s pass holders** please write in to <https://beta.moe.govhave.sg/contact-us/>. 

#### 9. What if I refused to go for the COVID-19 test?

During the SHN period, you may be required to report for a COVID-19 test as part of the SHN requirements. 

It will be a breach of the SHN requirements if you do not undergo the COVID-19 test.

Those who fail to comply with the SHN requirements may be prosecuted in court for an offence under Singapore law, including the Infectious Diseases Act and/or any regulations promulgated thereunder, such as the Infectious Diseases (COVID-19 – Stay Orders) Regulations 2020. Upon conviction, you may be liable to imprisonment, or a fine, or both. 

In addition, if you are a:
- Singapore permanent resident or long-term pass holder (Long-Term Visit Pass/ Dependant’s Pass/ Student’s Pass), your Re-entry Permit or passes may be revoked, or the validity shortened and you may be barred from entering Singapore in future.
- Short-term visitor, your visit pass may be cancelled and you may be barred from entering Singapore in future.
- Work pass holder, your work pass may be revoked.
- Full-time student attending a preschool, school or other educational institution in Singapore, you might be subject to disciplinary action, including suspension or dismissal.

#### 10. Do I have to complete my SHN if I have been tested negative for COVID-19?

You are required to complete your SHN even if the result of your COVID-19 test is negative. You are required to continue to remain at your dedicated SHN facilities/place of residence till you have completed your SHN. An SHN duration calculator can be found [here](https://service2.mom.gov.sg/shn/shn-calculator/).

#### 11. I am travelling with my child. Will my child be required to undergo a pre-departure test before entry into Singapore? Are children and infants exempted from the pre-departure test?

All travellers (who are not Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents) who are required to serve a 14-day SHN will be required to present a valid negative COVID-19 test result as a condition of entry into Singapore. 

Travellers who **arrived in Singapore by 31 December 2021, 2359 hours, and are born in 2015** are exempted from presenting a valid negative test result.

#### 12. Why do children need to undergo a COVID-19 test?

Regardless of age, infected individuals can transmit COVID-19 to other members of the community if undetected. As travel volume increases, there is a need to detect cases early and minimise the public health risk of community transmission. Hence, we are extending COVID-19 testing for inbound travellers to include children aged 7 and above (in that calendar year). Countries around the world are similarly requiring children to be tested.

Early detection will also facilitate prompt medical management, where needed.

#### 13. My child is very sensitive/has nosebleeds. Can he/she be excused from the SHN+ exit swab?

All children will be swabbed by trained personnel and it is a safe procedure. Should your child be assessed to have medical contraindications for the default testing method, alternative arrangements will be made.

#### 14. If my child is unwell, can the swab appointment be postponed?

Any person on SHN in an SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF) who is not feeling well, including children, must inform the SDFs immediately and medical care will be arranged for the individual. PSHNs with acute respiratory infection symptoms will not be swabbed at the SDF and alternative arrangements will be made.

You can contact the relevant parties (SHN helpline, MOM, MOE) to reschedule the swab appointment.

#### 15. If my child is unwell, can the swab appointment be postponed?

Yes. Children aged 12 and under (in that calendar year) who fit the suspect case definition for COVID-19 or are close contacts of infected cases are required to undergo a swab test. Children with acute respiratory infection but do not meet the suspect criteria may also opt to undergo a swab test.

#### 1. I have an upcoming flight to Singapore. Do I need to take a pre-departure test before travelling to Singapore? 

Travellers who are not Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents and who are required to serve a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN), will be required to take a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 72 hours before departure. Travellers will need to present a valid negative COVID-19 test result in order to board the flight and at immigration in Singapore. 

Travellers on stipulated COVID-19 travel channels (e.g. Green/Fast Lane arrangements, or designated Air Travel Bubble (ATB) flights from Hong Kong) are required to comply with prevailing border health conditions stipulated as part of their entry permits. 

Please click [here](/health) for the latest border measures.

#### 2. I am transiting via Singapore. Do I still need to have a valid negative COVID-19 test result?

At this point in time, travellers will only be able to transit through Singapore Changi Airport if they are travelling with an airline whose transfer route has been approved. Travellers are encouraged to confirm with their airlines on their eligibility to travel. 

Currently, only travellers from India, Indonesia or Philippines who are transiting through Singapore (i.e. India via Singapore to destination country) will have to present a valid negative COVID-19 test result. 

#### 3. I have an upcoming flight to Singapore. What kind of COVID-19 tests will be accepted? 

Singapore only accepts RT-PCR test results from labs in the country that are [internationally accredited or recognised](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/accreditation-bodies-for-covid-19-testing) by the respective Government. The test result memo must state the negative test result in English, date that the test was taken, traveller/s name and either Date of Birth or Passport Number as stated in the passport. If the personal details used are not stated in the passport, the traveller should have the relevant identity document on hand for verification. 

#### 4. I have an upcoming flight to Singapore. When must my pre-departure test (PDT) be taken before the flight to be accepted for arrival in Singapore?

Inbound travellers, who are not Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents and who are required to serve a 14-day SHN, must take a COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours before departure in order to enter Singapore. 

**Direct flight**

For travellers who take a direct flight, the 72 hours will be counted from the departure of the flight to Singapore.

**Connecting flights**

For travellers who have to take a connecting flight(s), the 72 hours will be counted from the departure of the first leg only and the total transit duration for the trip must not be more than 24 hours. If the total transit duration is more than 24 hours, a PDT must be taken within 72 hours from the last leg (i.e. the flight to Singapore).  

For negative test result requirements, please refer to **question 3**.

Travellers on stipulated COVID-19 travel channels (e.g. Green/Fast Lane arrangements, or designated Air Travel Bubble (ATB) flights from Hong Kong) are required to comply with prevailing border health conditions stipulated as part of their entry permits.  

#### 5.	I am travelling with my child. Will my child be required to undergo a pre-departure test before entry into Singapore? Are children and infants exempted from the pre-departure test?

All travellers (who are not Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents) who are required to serve a 14-day SHN will be required to present a valid negative COVID-19 test result as a condition of entry into Singapore. 

Travellers who **arrived in Singapore by 31 December 2021, 2359 hours, and are born in 2015** are exempted from presenting a valid negative test result. 

#### 6.	Are returning travellers to Singapore on the Reciprocal Green Lane (RGLs) subjected to the PDT before return to Singapore?

Please click [here](/rgl/overview) to find out more on the Reciprocal Green Lane arrangements.  

#### 7.	I have recovered from COVID-19. Can I still travel to Singapore if I test positive on my COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours before departure? 

If the pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test result is positive, the recovered individual must be able to provide documentary proof of his/her past diagnosis of COVID-19, based on his/her first ever positive PCR test result in English with the date of test and traveller’s identification details clearly stated. The date of the first ever positive PCR test result must be between 22 to 180 days prior to the date of arrival in Singapore. The documentary proof should be presented to the airline before boarding and to the immigration officers at the checkpoints in Singapore. If unable to provide documentary proof, the recovered individual will be denied boarding for flights bound for Singapore.

Please also note that individuals with a recent diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in the past 21 days will be denied boarding for flights bound for Singapore. 

#### 8. I have received a COVID-19 vaccination. Do I need to declare my vaccinated status? Will I still be subjected to prevailing border measures and stay-home-notice requirements?

MOH is actively monitoring the vaccine situation, including studies on the effectiveness of vaccines in reducing transmission risk. As these studies are still ongoing, all travellers, including those who have undergone vaccination, will continue to be subject to prevailing border measures and SHN requirements. We will review these requirements as more information on vaccine effectiveness becomes available. All travellers are advised to refer to the latest border measures on the Safe Travel website.

#### 9.	What will happen if I arrive in Singapore and do not have a valid negative PCR test certificate?

Travellers (who are not Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents) from countries where a valid negative COVID-19 test result is required as a condition for entry into Singapore, but are unable to produce a valid negative COVID-19 test result, will be denied entry into Singapore.

Airlines, Charterers and Air Operators for any flights to Singapore must conduct checks to ensure that passengers meet the requirement before they are allowed for boarding. Air operators will be responsible to repatriate any passenger rejected at the checkpoint.

If passengers are found to have produced false/forged COVID-19 test certificates, it will affect their ability to obtain or sponsor immigration facilities in the future.

#### 10. I am travelling to Singapore with my young child. Will my child be required to undergo the COVID-19 test before the end of SHN or upon arrival?
#### 11. Do children need to undergo a COVID-19 test when they arrive in Singapore? 

As of 14 December 2020, 2359 hours, children aged 6 and below (in that calendar year) are not required to undergo a COVID-19 test when entering Singapore or before the end of their SHN. However, if they meet the suspect criteria for COVID-19 or are exposed to other persons who have COVID-19, they would be required to undergo testing. 

#### 12. why do children need to undergo a COVID-19 test?

Regardless of age, infected individuals can transmit COVID-19 to other members of the community if undetected. As travel volume increases, there is a need to detect cases early and minimise the public health risk of community transmission. Hence, we are extending COVID-19 testing for inbound travellers to include children aged 7 and above (in that calendar year). Countries around the world are similarly requiring children to be tested. 

Early detection will also facilitate prompt medical management, where needed. 

#### 13. My child is very sensitive/has nosebleeds. Can he/she be excused from the SHN+ exit swab?

All children will be swabbed by trained personnel and it is a safe procedure. Should your child be assessed to have medical contraindications for the default testing method, alternative arrangements will be made.

#### 14. If my child is unwell, can the swab appointment be postponed?

Any person on SHN in an SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF) who is not feeling well, including children, must inform the SDFs immediately and medical care will be arranged for the individual. PSHNs with acute respiratory infection symptoms will not be swabbed at the SDF and alternative arrangements will be made.

You can contact the relevant parties (SHN helpline, MOM, MOE) to reschedule the swab appointment. 

#### 15. Are children in Singapore also subject to COVID-19 swabs/tests? 

Yes. Children aged 12 and under (in that calendar year) who fit the suspect case definition for COVID-19 or are close contacts of infected cases are required to undergo a swab test. Children with acute respiratory infection but do not meet the suspect criteria may also opt to undergo a swab test.

They are required to bring along an electronic or physical copy of their insurance policy before departing for Singapore.

#### 5.	Must the insurance be bought prior to their travel to Singapore? Can travellers purchase it upon arrival in Singapore?

Yes, the insurance must  be bought prior to their travel to Singapore. 

#### 6.	Are foreign travellers entitled to use public hospitals?

Foreign travellers who test positive for COVID-19  receive care in private hospitals.

#### 7.	What does the S$30,000 requirement cover?

The S$30,000 minimum insurance requirement refers to coverage for COVID-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs. 

#### 8.	What is the basis of setting the minimum insurance coverage requirement at S$30,000?

The requirement is based on COVID-19 bill sizes at private hospitals. 

#### 9.	How much are the typical hospital bills?

The cost of COVID-19 treatment varies depending on the patient’s clinical condition. The insurance coverage was sized to cover the majority of COVID-19 hospital bills in private hospitals.

#### 10.	How much are the premiums? 

The premiums would depend on factors such as the country/region from which the traveller is departing from, the length of the trip and/or factors such as the travellers’ age. More details can be found on the respective insurers’ websites. 

#### 11.	Will this requirement cover all short-term visitors? How about short-term visitors from the other travel lanes? 

The Government will review whether to extend the requirement to short-term visitors from other countries, taking into consideration the availability of products in the insurance market.

#### 12.	Do recovered COVID-19 visitors need to buy insurance? How about vaccinated travellers? 

Yes, both recovered and vaccinated foreign travellers need to buy insurance before travel to Singapore. There is still a risk that these travellers can get the COVID-19 infection, and require medical attention or hospitalisation for evaluation.

#### 13.	Should the COVID-19 treatment cost go beyond $30,000, who will pay the excess? 

As per existing practice, travellers will have to pay for their own treatment costs beyond insurance coverage. 

Visitors and/or hosts will be required to declare, at the point of application, that they have purchased or will be purchasing travel insurance that meets MOH’s minimum coverage requirements for the duration of their stay in Singapore, and will pay for any treatment costs beyond the insurance coverage, before being given approval to travel to Singapore.

#### 14.	Would Long Term Pass Holders be required to buy insurance? 

With effect from 1 Jan 2021, all Work Permit and S Pass holders entering Singapore must be covered by insurance for COVID-19 treatment if the pass holder develops COVID-19 symptoms or test positive within 14 days of arrival into Singapore. 

All other Long-Term Pass holders, (i.e., Employment Pass holders, Dependant’s Pass Holders, Student’s Pass Holders and Long-Term Visit Pass Holders), are encouraged to purchase insurance as the Government will no longer bear the costs of COVID-19 treatment if they develop COVID-19 symptoms or test positive within 14 days of arrival into Singapore.
