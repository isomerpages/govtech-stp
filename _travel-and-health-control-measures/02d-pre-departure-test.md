### Pre-Departure Test

Travellers required by the destination country/region to take a COVID-19 test in Singapore before departure can do so at any of these clinics [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/licensing-and-regulation/regulations-guidelines-and-circulars/details/list-of-covid-19-swab-providers). 

#### Making an appointment

Travellers are responsible for ensuring that the test conducted by the clinic meets the testing requirements of the destination country/region. Travellers should also allocate adequate time to take and receive their test result before departure from Singapore. In general, travellers who present themselves at the clinic less than 38 hours before the scheduled flight may not receive their test results on time.

Any cost incurred for travel-related tests will be borne by the traveller, which the traveller can enquire with the clinic before making an appointment. Government subsidies will not be given for these tests.

To make an appointment, travellers should have the following information ready:
- Identity card (for Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Long-Term Pass Holders only and passport (for all travellers)
- Departure flight timing (if applicable)
- Possible times for your test slot
- Address in Singapore
- Contact number
- Email address to receive the result memo

#### Day of Appointment 

On the day of the PCR test appointment, travellers will be asked to present the following: 
- Identity card (for Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Long-Term Pass Holders only and passport (for all travellers)
- Softcopy booking reference showing your departure flight timing (if applicable)
- Fees for COVID-19 Pre-Departure Test – Government-paid swabs are not allowed to be used for the issuance of Pre-Departure COVID-19 travel memos

#### Notαrise for Digital PDT Certificates

From 10 March 2021 onwards, MOH has mandated that all Pre-Departure Test (PDT) results be issued in the form of a digital certificate compliant with the HealthCerts schema and standards. The list of clinics able to offer digital PDTs will be updated in due course.

All outbound travellers taking their PDTs in Singapore will receive a digital results certificate, and are required to digitally authenticate and endorse the digital test certificate via <www.notarise.gov.sg> before travel. This ensures that the result and certificate is issued and authenticated by MOH (i.e. it is issued by an approved clinic/lab and has not been tampered with).

After using <www.notarise.gov.sg>, the QR code of your digitally authenticated and endorsed test certificate will be e-mailed to you within 15 minutes. If you have presented your NRIC at the clinic, the QR code will also be automatically uploaded onto your SingPass mobile app. The QR code can be shown to foreign immigration & customs authorities, who may scan the QR code with any reader (e.g. normal phone camera) to verify the authenticity of the digital certificate.
