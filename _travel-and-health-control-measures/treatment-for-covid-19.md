## Mandatory Treatment upon Positive Test for COVID-19

In accordance with Singapore’s Infectious Diseases Act, it is **mandatory** that all travellers who test positive for COVID-19 be isolated for treatment and recovery at the appropriate facility. COVID-19-positive patients will be conveyed to and accorded the necessary medical treatment at a suitable COVID-19 care facility. These facilities can be the following hospitals and/or Community Care Facilities (CCFs), depending on the patient’s condition:
- All public and private Acute Hospitals
- Bright Vision Hospital
- Tuas South CCF
- D’Resort

Patients who are first admitted to a hospital for COVID-19 management may subsequently be transferred to a CCF for continued care. Such patients will be medically managed at the CCF until they are fit for discharge. 

<u>Patients may not choose the specific hospital or CCF to be treated at</u>, and all decisions to convey the patient to the appropriate COVID-19 care facility made by the Government of Singapore will be final. 

Patients who deliberately refuse treatment or leave the facility before a formal discharge, or otherwise behave in a manner that exposes others to the risk of infection, may be prosecuted for offences under the Infectious Diseases Act. Upon conviction, the offender may be imprisoned and/or fined.  

## Costs of Hospitalisation

Singapore Citizens (SCs), Permanent Residents (PRs), Long Term Pass Holders (LTPHs) **are responsible for all charges of their medical bills** if they test positive for COVID-19 or have onset of symptoms within 14 days of their arrival to Singapore. SCs and PRs may use Government subsidies, MediSave and MediShield Life/Integrated Shield Plans to help pay for their bills.  LTPHs may tap on private insurance, if applicable.

All Short Term Visit Pass holders (STVPs) are likewise responsible for all charges of their medical bills if they test positive for COVID-19 at any point during their stay in Singapore.  There are no subsidies available to STVPs.  

**Travel insurance with COVID-19 coverage is mandated** for STVP and selected groups of LTPHs (i.e., Work Permit/Work Permit Training/S-Pass Holders) arriving in Singapore. Please refer [here](/health/travelinsurance) for the insurance requirements and a list of Singapore-based travel insurance products that can help to cover COVID-19 related treatment costs.

The hospitals and CCF charges are billed separately. All travellers may enquire about the relevant charges at the point of financial counselling at the point of admission to the hospital or CCF.

This cost of hospitalisation at the hospitals and/or CCFs are separate from the cost of Stay Home Designated Facilities.
