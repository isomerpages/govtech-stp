The Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) and Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will issue an Electronic Monitoring Device (“device”) to travellers above 12 and are serving their Stay-Home Notice (SHN) outside the SHN-Dedicated Facility (SDF). It is used solely to detect travellers that have wilfully left their SHN accommodation before the specified period. 

Your personal privacy is protected while using these devices. The device does not have any audio or video recording capabilities. All location data is transmitted via end-to-end encryption and can only be accessed by authorised government officials for investigation.

It uses Bluetooth signals and alerts the authorities if the distance between the wristband and gateway at home is beyond a pre-defined range but cannot relay the exact current location of its wearer. You may wish to refer to the User Setup Guide <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/covid-19/stayhomesg-user-setup-guide.pdf">here</a> and Frequently Asked Questions on the StayHome@SG app <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/covid-19/stay@homesg-faqs.pdf">here</a>. <br/><br/>

It also has other features, including a sensor that will trigger alert should the wearer tampers or removes the smartwatch.
