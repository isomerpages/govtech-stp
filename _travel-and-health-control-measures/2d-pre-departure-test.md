Travellers are responsible to check if the test conducted by the clinic meets the testing requirements of the destination country/region. Travellers should also allocate adequate time to take and receive their test result before departure from Singapore.

Any cost incurred for travel-related tests will be borne by the traveller, which the traveller can enquire with the clinic before making an appointment. Government subsidies will not be given for these tests.

To make an appointment, travellers should have the following information ready:
