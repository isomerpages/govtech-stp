## Mandatory COVID-19 Travel Insurance

### Short-term Visitors

With effect from 31 January 2021, 2359 hours, short-term visitors applying to enter Singapore via the [Air Travel Pass (ATP)](/atp/overview) and [Reciprocal Green Lanes (RGLs)](/rgl/overview) will need to have travel insurance for their COVID-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs in Singapore, with a minimum coverage of S$30,000. The travel insurance will help them pay for the costs of their medical treatment in Singapore.

Visitors should <u>purchase such travel insurance prior to travelling to Singapore</u>, either from Singapore-based or overseas insurers. 

A list of available Singapore-based travel insurance products* are as follows:

<b><i>All Short Term Visitors entering via [ATP](/atp/overview) and [RGL](/rgl/overview) are required to prepare an electronic or physical copy of their insurance policy to bring with them to facilitate their entry into Singapore. </i></b>

The mandatory travel insurance <u>does not</u> apply to Singapore Citizens/Permanent Residents (SCs/PRs), as they are able to access Government subsidies and MediShield Life / Integrated Shield Plans to help pay for their medical bills, should they develop onset of symptoms for COVID-19 within 14 days of their return.

### Work Permit, Training Work Permit and S Pass Holders

Employers must buy COVID-19 medical insurance for all Work Permit, Training Work Permit and S Pass holders entering Singapore, <b><u>before your workers arrive in Singapore</u></b>.

The insurance must meet these requirements:
<ul>
<li>Covers <b>at least $10,000</b> for medical expenses if the worker develops COVID-19 symptoms or tests positive within 14 days of arrival in Singapore.</li>
<li>Covers workers on work pass in-principle approvals (IPAs).</li>
</ul>

Employers should check with your insurer whether your workers’ existing medical insurance plans meet the above requirements. If not, you can refer to this <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/frequently-asked-questions/eligible-claims-and-medical-benefits">link</a> (see FAQ <i>“Where can I buy COVID-19 insurance”</i> for eligible products).
