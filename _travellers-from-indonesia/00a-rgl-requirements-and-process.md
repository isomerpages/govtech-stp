---

On 12 October 2020, Singapore and Indonesia agreed to implement the Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL) to facilitate essential short-term business and official travel between both countries.

The Singapore – Indonesia RGL is only applicable to all residents in Singapore travelling to Indonesia, and Indonesian citizens travelling to Singapore through Jakarta (Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (Tangerang) or Batam (Batam Center Ferry Terminal).  

The SafeTravel Pass is a mandatory document for inbound travellers for essential business or official travel from Indonesia to Singapore under Green Lane arrangements. 

### **Application**

Business or official travellers seeking to travel via the RGL to Singapore must be sponsored<sup>1</sup> by either a Singapore-based company or a Singapore Government agency, which will file an application on behalf of the applicant for a SafeTravel Pass.  

When the SafeTravel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be issued to the sponsoring company or government agency.

IMPORTANT 

 - Travellers (who are not Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents or Long-Term Pass holders) without a valid SafeTravel Pass will be refused entry into Singapore.

## **Process Overview**

### **Before entering Singapore**

The approved applicant will have to electronically submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations and declare his/her accommodation in Singapore via the [SG Arrival Card](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/), before departing for Singapore. The SG Arrival Card can also be accessed via the [Visit Singapore Travel Guide App](https://www.visitsingapore.com/travel-guide-tips/visit-singapore-travel-guide-app/).

#### Pre-Departure Measures

Prior to travelling to Singapore, approved SafeTravel Pass travellers must: 
 - Have not travelled out of Indonesia in the entirety of the 14 days prior to departure; 
 - Take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 72 hours from departure and obtain a certificate of having tested negative for COVID-19, at the traveller’s own cost. The certificate must be issued by medical institutions designated by the Government of Indonesia and recognised by Singapore. The health certificate must be in English and clearly state the time and date the PCR test was taken. 
 - Monitor their health status and defer travel if feeling unwell; travellers with symptoms, i.e. febrile or visual signs of acute respiratory infection, can be refused entry into Singapore.  
 
At pre-boarding checks, approved SafeTravel Pass travellers must produce: 
 - A valid SafeTravel Pass for the intended week of travel; 
 - A valid certificate of negative result for a COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours before departure for Singapore;
 - A return air or ferry ticket or proof of other transportation arrangements (e.g. private transportation) to depart Singapore. 
 
 Travellers who do not produce the documents above at pre-boarding or immigration checks can be refused boarding.
 
### **Arrival and Stay in Singapore**

#### Post-Arrival Measures

The SafeTravel Pass traveller will undergo a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival in Singapore at his/her own cost.

At on-arrival immigration checks, approved SafeTravel Pass travellers must produce: 
 - A valid SafeTravel Pass for the intended week of travel; 
 - A valid certificate of negative result for a COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours before departure for Singapore;
 - A return air or ferry ticket or proof of other transportation arrangements (e.g. private transportation) to depart Singapore.

Applicants without these documents can be refused entry into Singapore under the RGL arrangement. 

The host<sup>2</sup> company or government agency will transport the traveller directly from the airport/ferry terminal to the declared self-sourced accommodation (non-residential address only), adhering to prevailing health measures. The traveller must remain isolated in the declared accommodation until the test result is released. 

If the result indicates that the traveller has tested negative for COVID-19, the traveller can proceed on the pre-declared controlled itinerary. If tested positive for COVID-19, the traveller will undergo prescribed medical treatment at his/her cost. 

#### Measures during stay in Singapore

SafeTravel Pass travellers to Singapore must subscribe to the relevant contact tracing mobile applications and technology solutions that are in place at the time of travel, including TraceTogether and SafeEntry for the entire duration of their stay in Singapore. A traveller who does not have a TraceTogether-compatible device should be provided with one by his/her host, for the duration of his/her stay in Singapore. If the traveller subsequently tests positive for COVID-19 while in Singapore or within 14 days after departure from Singapore, he/she will be required to upload his/her TraceTogether data.

In addition to abiding by prevailing local public health and safety distancing measures, SafeTravel Pass travellers must adhere to a pre-submitted controlled itinerary that is supervised by the host company or government agency for his/her stay in Singapore (with a maximum duration of 10 days).  The traveller is prohibited from using public transportation during his/her stay, with the exception of private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport
