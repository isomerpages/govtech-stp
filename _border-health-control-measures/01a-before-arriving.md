## Pre-Departure to Singapore

### 1. Obtain Entry Approval

With the exception of Singapore citizens and permanent residents, all travellers must obtain an entry approval to enter Singapore. Approvals can be obtained from the relevant government agencies (e.g. MOE, MOM), or via the application for a Safe Travel pass (details [here](/arriving/overview). Travellers without an entry approval will be denied entry and may have their existing work passes revoked.

If unsure which entry lanes and health requirements are applicable to you to enter Singapore depending on your country of departure and traveller type, please click [here](/arriving/overview) to find out more.

### 2. Apply for Visa (If Applicable)

Travellers who require a [visa](https://www.ica.gov.sg/visitor/visitor_entryvisa) to enter Singapore should submit their visa applications after they have obtained the requisite entry approvals under the prevailing border control measure. Those previously issued with visas, which had been suspended due to COVID-19 and are still valid, do not need to apply for a new visa. 

Click [here](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save) to check if your visa remains valid.

A requisite entry approval as well as a valid visa must be obtained prior to travelling to and seeking entry into Singapore.

### 3. COVID-19 Test before departing for Singapore (If Applicable)

Depending on the traveller’s scheme of travel (e.g. Reciprocal Green Lane), he/she may be required to take a COVID-19 PCR test before departing for Singapore. Whether a traveller needs to be tested before departing for Singapore is set out in the Terms and Conditions of the Safe Travel passes governing entry into Singapore.

Travellers who have been approved for entry will be required to take a COVID-19 PCR test **within 72 hours before departure** for Singapore, if he/she:
- Is a non-Singapore citizen or non-Singapore permanent resident; and
- Has a recent travel history to <u>India, Indonesia, or Philippines within the last 14 days prior to entry into Singapore</u>.

These travellers must present a valid negative COVID-19 PCR test result, in English and from recognised laboratories, to enter Singapore. The test result must contain the following details:
- Date the test was taken
- Particulars of traveller as indicated in the passport (Name, Date of Birth, nationality and passport number)

Children who are 12 years old and below do not need to take the COVID-19 PCR test.

Upon arrival, these travellers are also obligated to serve a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at the dedicated SHN facilities and take another COVID-19 PCR test before completing their SHN.

### 4. Application for opting out of Dedicated Stay-Home Notice (SHN) Facility
Travellers from Fiji, Finland, Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Turkey may opt out of dedicated SHN facilities and serve their 14-day SHN at their place of residence, if they fulfil the following criteria:

- Travelled to no other country than above-mentioned countries, in the last consecutive 14 days prior to entry; and
- Are occupying their place of residence (i.e. residential address) alone, or only with household members who are also persons serving SHN with the same travel history and duration of SHN.

Applications must be made at least three days prior to arrival in Singapore. Applications can be submitted [here](/sc-pr/opt-out/apply-now) starting from 2 November 2020 for Singapore citizens (SC) and permanent residents (PRs). Non SCs or PRs may apply to opt out as part of the entry approval process.

The list of [countries/regions](/files/SHN-and-swab-summary.pdf) eligible for opt-out of dedicated SHN facilities will be updated from time to time depending on the public health risk assessment. Travellers must be prepared that any prior approvals given for opt-out from dedicated SHN facilities may be revoked, and the prevailing border measures upon entry will apply, including stay in SHN dedicated facility and payment, where applicable.

### 5. Submission of Health Declaration

All travellers must submit a pre-trip health and travel history declaration via the <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/" target="_blank">SG Arrival Card (SGAC) e-Service</a> 3 days before arrival in Singapore.
