If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status through <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save>. Those who did not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will not need to apply for a visa for fast lane travel.

#### 23. What health measures will I be subjected to upon arrival in Singapore?

Fast lane travellers from China must take a PCR test after arrival in Singapore, and remain isolated in a declared self-sourced accommodation until their test results are released (typically within 48 hours). The traveller's accommodation throughout the entire duration of his/her stay in Singapore must be a non-residential address and he/she may not reside in a residential address at any point in time. Transportation from the airport to the declared accommodation will have to be provided by the host company or government agency subject to prevailing health measures<sup>3</sup>. Travellers will bear the costs of the post-arrival PCR test in Singapore and stay in the declared accommodation.

If the result indicates that the traveller has tested negative for COVID-19, the host company or government agency will ensure that the traveller is transported directly from the declared accommodation to the workplace and back according to the submitted controlled itinerary for the first 14 days of the traveller’s stay in Singapore. The traveller may not use public transportation for this purpose, with the exception of private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport<sup>4</sup>.

Travellers to Singapore must use the TraceTogether app and SafeEntry<sup>5</sup>, take their temperature twice daily, report their health status to the host company or government agency, and adhere to prevailing public health requirements for the duration of their stay in Singapore.

#### 24. What is the TraceTogether app? Does the Singapore Government track my movements via the app?

The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s phone, and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data.

The app works best on phones with Android version 5.1 and above, as well as phones with iOS version 10 and above.  More information on the app can be found at <https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg>.

#### 25. What is SafeEntry?

SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that logs the NRIC/FINs and mobile numbers of individuals visiting hotspots, workplaces of essential services, as well as selected public venues to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 through activities such as contact tracing and identification of COVID-19 clusters.

More information can be found at <https://www.safeentry.gov.sg>.

### **Returning to China**

#### 26. Do I need to be tested again in Singapore before I return to China?

After the first 14 days, inter-provincial/municipal travel for the non-fast lane regions within China will be allowed for a fast lane traveller from Singapore, as long as he/she adheres to the same domestic travel restrictions imposed on residents in China to move between those provinces/municipalities concerned.

As some provinces/municipalities may require additional COVID-19 test(s) before the traveller is allowed to embark on inter-provincial/municipal travel, the traveller’s local host company or government agency should check with the relevant local provincial/municipality authorities if there are any such requirements.

The traveller may contact his/her host company or government agency in China to make the necessary arrangements in China.

The traveller will need to adhere to the clinic’s cut-off timings for the pre-departure tests to ensure that he/she is able to obtain the test results in time to be allowed to check-in for his/her flight.

The traveller must also obtain a letter from the PRC Embassy in Singapore which confirms that he/she has been granted approval by the relevant authorities in China to travel to China under the Singapore-China Fast Lane. This letter will be used as an indication of the traveller’s eligibility to take a pre-departure COVID-19 test. This letter must be presented at the clinic before the test can be administered.

The traveller should expect to pay up to S$200 (inclusive of GST) for the pre-departure test. This is not payable by MediSave, MediShield Life and Integrated Shield Plans.

#### 9. I had a swab done previously for Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI). Can I use the test results for travel under the RGL?

The Chinese authorities require a traveller to test negative for both the post-arrival PCR test and serology test before the traveller can proceed with his/her travel plans in China.

### **Pre-Departure in Singapore**

#### 13. What documentation do I need to present to the airline staff at check-in before I will be allowed to board a flight from Singapore to China?

Minimally, a traveller should have on hand his/her negative COVID-19 PCR test result, a valid visa and a Letter of Invitation issued by the Chinese provincial/municipal authorities of Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin or Zhejiang specifically for essential business or official travel under the fast lane.

As the specific requirements may vary amongst provinces/municipalities, the traveller should verify the latest requirements with his/her local host company or government agency.

### **Health Measures in China**

#### 14. Do I need to be quarantined upon arrival in China?

After undergoing a PCR test and serology test upon arrival, the traveller must remain in a centralised quarantine area designated by the local provincial/municipal government for one to two days until the test results are released. The traveller has to bear the costs of the post-arrival tests and the one to two days’ stay in the designated location.

If the traveller tests negative for both COVID-19 tests, the host company or government agency will transport the traveller directly from the above-mentioned location designated by the local provincial/municipal government to the workplace or residence.

#### 15. What other health measures will I be subject to in China? What would qualify as a “controlled itinerary” in China?

The traveller must follow local COVID-19 prevention and control measures for the duration of his/her stay in China, including downloading the local health QR code used in the province/municipality.

##### 3. How can I make an appointment for pre-departure PCR testing?

For fast lane travel to China, the pre-departure PCR test must be done within 72 hours prior to departure.

Please call the clinic and book your test slot before the Cut-Off Test Timing in the schedule above. This is to ensure that you will have sufficient time to meet the fast lane requirements.

##### 4. How far in advance should I make an appointment for the pre-departure PCR test?

Due to limited slots, please make your appointment with the clinic **as early as possible**, once your flight timing and your fast lane application is approved.

Please refer to the **Schedule for the “Latest Cut-off Test Timing” and book your test slot within the indicated timing**. This is to ensure that you meet the fast lane requirements.

If you do not make a prior appointment, please note that:
1. There is no guarantee that there will be a test slot for you; and
2. You may not get your results in time for your flight to qualify for fast lane arrangements.

Travellers who miss the cut-off test timing will <u>not</u> be able to obtain a test result in time for their flight.

##### 5. What details will I need to book an appointment for the PCR test?

Please have the following information on hand when making an appointment for your test:
1. Identity card number or passport number
2. Departure flight timing
3. Required test window based on your destination country
4. Possible times for your test slot: Please refer to the Test Schedule to confirm your timing

##### Testing

##### 7. What if I miss my test timing? What if I take my test after the Cut-off Test Timing?

Travellers who miss the Cut-off Test Timing will not be able to obtain a test result in time for their flight.

Please make arrangements early for your test slot so that you can qualify for the fast lane arrangements.

##### 8. What happens if the clinic assesses that I am unable to receive the PCR test for unforeseen circumstances?

If you are unable to receive the test, you may wish to reschedule your flight, if you still wish to tap on the fast lane arrangement.

##### Test Results

You will receive your PCR test results and memo at least three hours before your flight.

The clinic will email the results to your email address. You will need to print and bring the memo overseas yourself.
