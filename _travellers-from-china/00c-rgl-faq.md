## **Application Process for Residents in China**

### **Application**

#### 1. Who is eligible to apply to travel to Singapore under the fast lane?

Persons of all nationalities who are legally resident in China, who need to make single-entry, short-term essential travel for business or official purposes travel between Singapore and the six fast lane regions in China (Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin and Zhejiang).

#### 2. I am a Singapore Citizen / Singapore Permanent Resident / Singapore Long-Term Pass holder* who is resident in China. Am I eligible to apply for the fast lane?

Yes. All residents in China who need to make short-term essential business or official travel between Singapore and the six fast lane regions in China (Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin and Zhejiang) are eligible to apply for the fast lane.

<p style="font-size: 1.0rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">* <em>Singapore Long-Term Pass holders who are eligible to apply for fast lane travel include holders of MOM-issued work passes (e.g. Employment Pass, EntrePass, Personalised Employment Pass, S Pass, Work Permit, Dependant’s Pass) and holders of the ICA-issued Long-Term Visit Pass.</em></p>

<p style="font-size: 1.0rem; line-height: 1.8rem;"><em>Long-Term Pass holders returning to Singapore after a visit to China via the fast lane should identify themselves as fast lane travellers during pre-departure airline checks in China and to ICA at Singapore immigration by presenting the Letter of Invitation issued by the Chinese provincial/municipal government of the fast lane region.</em></p>

#### 3. What is a SafeTravel Pass?

A SafeTravel Pass is required for residents in China to seek entry into Singapore under the fast lane. It is non-transferable and will be valid for a single entry into Singapore anytime within the stipulated week (0000hrs Monday to 2359hrs Sunday). Travellers must enter Singapore within this stipulated week, and can stay in Singapore for the duration of their Visit Pass issued at the immigration checkpoint in Singapore.

SafeTravel Passes will be issued on a limited basis in order to manage the risk of imported COVID-19 cases.

Please send an email to <COVID_SafeTravelEnquiries@mti.gov.sg> if you have further queries related to the SafeTravel Pass.

#### 4. How do residents in China apply to travel to Singapore under the fast lane? What are the steps from the time I put in an application to the time I obtain a visa? How long is the processing time? What documents do I need to submit?

Residents in China seeking to travel to Singapore via the fast lane must be hosted by a company or a government agency in Singapore. The host company can file the application for a SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller either directly at <https://go.gov.sg/rglapp>, or through a sponsoring government agency.<sup>1</sup>

The application for the SafeTravel Pass will be open 20 working days (excluding the date of application and date of entry) before the day of the traveller’s planned departure. The processing of the application can take up to 7 working days. Applications submitted less than 7 working days from planned departure will not be accepted. You are encouraged to apply for the SafeTravel Pass as early as possible, factoring in the time necessary for the processing of the SafeTravel Pass application, visa application (if needed) and taking a pre-departure COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test before departure for Singapore.

When the SafeTravel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be issued to the applicant and the sponsoring company / government agency by email. With this letter, an approved applicant who is a visa-required passport holder will proceed to apply for a visa for travel to Singapore through the usual channels (Singapore overseas missions, authorised visa agents, local contact or companies) at least 4 working days before departure. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status through <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save>. Those who did not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will not need to apply for a visa for fast lane travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

The approved applicant will have to submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations as well as declare his/her accommodation electronically via the SG Arrival Card (<https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/>), within 3 days prior to the date of arrival in Singapore.

Within 48 hours of the traveller’s departure from China, the sponsoring company or government agency should submit the traveller’s **negative COVID-19 test result and controlled itinerary** in Singapore at <https://go.gov.sg/rglsuppdocs>. The traveller is required to produce a valid SafeTravel Pass, a negative COVID-19 PCR test result, a return air ticket, and a valid visa (for visa-required passport holders) for pre-boarding checks at the airlines check-in counter and immigration counter. Otherwise, he/she may be refused boarding.

#### 5. What are the responsibilities of the host company who is self-sponsoring?

When a company is sponsoring a traveller, it will have to be responsible for the application of the SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller as well as the timely submission of the accompanying documents.

The host company should also ensure that the traveller abides by the terms and conditions of the Singapore-China Fast Lane, and the prevailing health measures during his/her stay in Singapore. Authorities may ask for proof of adherence, including physical verification or SafeEntry Pass records (e.g. screenshots), to the controlled itinerary and other terms and conditions when the traveller is in Singapore.

You can access the terms and conditions of the Singapore-China Fast Lane at <https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/china/rgl/terms-and-conditions>. Actions will be taken against the traveller and the host company in the event of non-compliance.

#### 6.	Can tourists apply for SafeTravel Passes?

SafeTravel Passes are only issued to travellers making short-term essential business and official travel. These passes are not applicable for tourists.

#### 7.	Can my SafeTravel Pass be transferred to my family member, friend, colleague or business partner?

SafeTravel Passes are not transferable to others.

#### 8.	Do I need to pay to apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

No payment is required.

#### 9. Is there a limit to the number of times I can apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

There is no limit to the number of times a traveller can apply for a SafeTravel Pass. Every entry to Singapore requires a new SafeTravel Pass application.

If the traveller’s SafeTravel Pass has expired, he/she should submit a new application.

#### 10. What visa will I be eligible for under the fast lane, and what is the duration of stay that I will be eligible for in Singapore?

Every application for a visa, including the type of visa granted, will be considered on its own merits and subject to approval. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/ she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status through <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save>.

Those who did not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will not need to apply for a visa for fast lane travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

Travellers who are granted entry into Singapore are generally issued with a Visit Pass, of which the duration would be aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### 11. How can I further extend my Visit Pass / stay when I am in Singapore, if necessary?

All applications for extension of Visit Pass must be submitted online using ICA’s e-Service (<https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/extend>) at least seven days prior to the expiry of the Visit Pass to avoid overstaying. Extension of Visit Pass will not be accepted over the counter. Each application is considered on its own merits.

#### 12. My travel plans have changed/some information in my application is incorrect. How can I amend the details of my SafeTravel Pass application/approved SafeTravel Pass?

The host company should resubmit the updated controlled itinerary on behalf of the traveller via the ‘Submission of Supporting Documents for SafeTravel Pass Application’ Form, at <https://go.gov.sg/rglsuppdocs>. This should be done even if the traveller is already in Singapore.

#### 13. What if I have changes to my controlled itinerary?

The host company should be responsible for monitoring and reporting any deviation in your controlled itinerary. The host company should resubmit the updated controlled itinerary on behalf of the traveller via the ‘Submission of Supporting Documents for SafeTravel Pass Application’ Form, at <https://go.gov.sg/rglsuppdocs>. This should be done even if the traveller is already in Singapore.

#### 14. Why was my application rejected?

SafeTravel Pass applications may be rejected for reasons, including the following:
1. The quota for the week of entry that the application was submitted was fully utilised. In this situation, you may consider submitting an application for a SafeTravel Pass for a different week of entry.
2. Application exceeds permissible window, i.e. not within 20 to 7 working days prior to departure. In this situation, please ensure that you submit the application earliest 20 working days prior to the date of entry into Singapore, and latest 7 working days before the date of entry into Singapore.
3. Inadequate information provided.

#### 15. I have submitted the necessary supporting documents prior to my departure from China to Singapore. Why did I receive a notification that the submission was unsuccessful?

You might have submitted the supporting documents earlier than the 48-hour window before the declared date of departure from China. You should submit the supporting documents only after receiving the results of the COVID-19 PCR test which has to be taken <u>within 48 hours</u> of departure from China. Please resubmit the necessary documents within the stipulated window prior to departure.

Do also ensure that the supporting documents submitted are in the correct format (pdf., jpeg.).

#### 16. Can I use the fast lane to come to Singapore for long-term work?

The fast lane is only for short-term essential business and official travel, and not for long-term work. Travellers seeking to enter Singapore for long-term work may wish to visit <https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits> for more information on a separate scheme.

To qualify for exemption from the Stay-Home-Notice (SHN) requirement, the Traveller must take the COVID-19 PCR test at the assigned swabbing station within the airport. Please approach the airport ground staff upon arrival for assistance.

Travellers are encouraged to pre-register and pre-pay for the COVID-19 PCR test prior to your entry into Singapore.

### **Health Measures in Singapore**

#### 23. What health measures will I will be subjected to upon arrival in Singapore?

Fast lane travellers from China must take a PCR test after arrival in Singapore, and remain isolated in a declared self-sourced accommodation (non-residential address only) until their test results are released (typically within 48 hours). Transportation from the airport to the declared accommodation will have to be provided by the host company or government agency subject to prevailing health measures<sup>3</sup>. Travellers will bear the costs of the post-arrival PCR test in Singapore and stay in the declared accommodation.

If the result indicates that the traveller has tested negative for COVID-19, the host company or government agency will ensure that the traveller is transported directly from the declared accommodation to the workplace and back according to the submitted controlled itinerary for the first 14 days of the traveller’s stay in Singapore. The traveller may not use public transportation for this purpose, with the exception of private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport<sup>4</sup>.

Travellers to Singapore must use the TraceTogether app and SafeEntry<sup>5</sup>, take their temperature twice daily, report their health status to the host company or government agency, and adhere to prevailing public health requirements for the duration of their stay in Singapore.

#### 24. What is the TraceTogether app? Does the Singapore Government track my movements via the app?

The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s phone, and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data.

The app works best on phones with Android version 5.1 and above. More information on the app can be found at <https://tracetogether.gov.sg>.

#### 27. What is SafeEntry?

SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that logs the NRIC/FINs and mobile numbers of individuals visiting hotspots, workplaces of essential services, as well as selected public venues to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 through activities such as contact tracing and identification of COVID-19 clusters.

More information can be found at <https://www.safeentry.gov.sg>.

### **Returning to China**

#### 28. Do I need to be tested again in Singapore before I return to China?

Yes, China requires <u>all</u> travellers departing for/returning to China from Singapore to be subject to a pre-departure PCR test. As such, fast lane returnees will have to be tested again in Singapore before returning to China.

A fast lane traveller returning to China can make an appointment in advance at certain clinics in Singapore for a pre-departure test at the traveller’s cost. The traveller must take the test and obtain a health certificate of having tested negative for COVID-19.

According to the guidelines by the Chinese government, the validity period of the negative certificate held by travellers from Singapore to China will be adjusted from 5 days to 3 days from 11 September 2020.

Persons of all nationalities who are legally resident in Singapore (i.e., Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, Long-Term Pass holders) who need to make single-entry, short term essential travel for business or official travel between Singapore and the six fast lane regions in China (Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Zhejiang).

The relevant Chinese government authorities will assess each application on a case-by-case basis.

#### 2.	How do Singapore residents apply to travel to China under the fast lane?

Residents in Singapore seeking to travel to China for essential business or official travel via the fast lane must be sponsored by either a company or a government agency in China, which will file an application on behalf of the applicant with the local provincial/municipal authorities.  As the application process and documents required for each province/municipality may vary, the local host company or government agency should check with the relevant local provincial/municipal authorities for more details. A list of these local authorities is at **<a href="#annexa">ANNEX A</a>**.

If the application is approved, a Letter of Invitation specifically for essential business or official travel under the fast lane will be issued to the applicant. The approved applicant will thereafter submit a visa application and health declaration to the PRC Embassy in Singapore, which will issue the applicant a visa. The requirement to obtain a visa also applies to Singaporeans visiting China for less than 15 days, as the 15-day visa free facility for Singaporeans travelling to China remains suspended by the PRC government until further notice. For more details on visa application, please contact the PRC Embassy in Singapore.

The traveller should work with his/her local host company or government agency to verify that he/she has fulfilled the fast lane requirements of the provincial/municipal authorities prior to departure for China. Besides taking a pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test and obtaining a negative test result within 48 hours before departure, this may also include other requirements such as keeping the local authorities informed of the traveller’s flight details, and submitting the traveller’s closed-loop itinerary to the local authorities. **Travellers should also confirm with the PRC Embassy in Singapore the latest procedures and requirements, including approval for closed-loop management, before their departure.** 

#### 3. What visas will I be eligible for under the fast lane, and what is the visa duration in China?

Those seeking to enter China for purposes other than essential business and official travel should contact the PRC Embassy in Singapore for further details.

#### 6.	Where in China may I travel to? What are the approvals which I will need to obtain to do so?

The fast lane is for travel between Singapore and the six fast lane regions in China (Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Zhejiang).

A traveller from Singapore who needs to travel between adjacent fast lane regions in China (e.g., from Shanghai to Jiangsu, or Shanghai to Zhejiang, etc.) within the first 14 days upon arrival, shall, through the host company or government agency, acquire in advance the approval (i.e., Letter of Invitation) from the relevant provincial/municipal authorities of the next destination.

The traveller is only allowed to use the private transport designated by his/her host company or government agency to travel to other fast lane regions. Travel via plane, rail, inter-city buses or other means of public transportation is not allowed.

After the first 14 days, inter-provincial/municipal travel for the non-fast lane regions within China will be allowed for a fast lane traveller from Singapore, as long as he/she adheres to the same domestic travel restrictions imposed on residents in China to move between those provinces/municipalities concerned.

As some provinces/municipalities may require additional COVID-19 test(s) before the traveller is allowed to embark on inter-provincial/municipal travel, the traveller’s local host company or government agency should check with the relevant local provincial/municipality authorities if there are any such requirements.

#### 7.	Who can I contact for more information on the arrangements in China, e.g., accommodation and transport?

The traveller may contact his/her host company or government agency in China to make the necessary arrangements in China.

### **Test Arrangements**

#### 8.	Where do I take a pre-departure PCR test in Singapore? How much does it cost to take the PCR test, and can I pay for it with MediSave or insurance?

The fast lane traveller departing for China can make an appointment in advance at designated clinics in Singapore for a pre-departure test at the traveller’s cost. The traveller must take the test within 48 hours before departure, and obtain a health certificate of having tested negative for COVID-19.

The list of clinics that can perform pre-departure COVID-19 tests isand details on the procedure to book an appointment are at **<a href="#annexb">ANNEX B</a>**. Testing for fast lane arrangements should only be carried out at these clinics at the moment. An eligible fast lane traveller should contact the clinic directly for testing.

The traveller will need to adhere to the clinic’s cut-off timings for the pre-departure tests to ensure that he/she is able to obtain the test results in time to be allowed to check-in for his/her flight.

The traveller must also obtain a letter from the PRC Embassy in Singapore which confirms that he/she has been granted approval by the relevant authorities in China to travel to China under the Singapore-China Fast Lane. This letter will be used as an indication of the traveller’s eligibility to take a pre-departure COVID-19 test. This letter must be presented at the clinic before the test can be administered.

The traveller should expect to pay up to S$200 (inclusive of GST) for the pre-departure test. This is not payable by MediSave, MediShield Life and Integrated Shield Plans.

#### 9. I had a swab done previously for Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI). Can I use the test results for travel under the RGL?

Travellers with ARI symptoms should not travel. They should postpone their travel plans.

#### 10.	What tests will I be subject to upon arrival in China? Will I be subject to a serology test in China?

A fast lane traveller to China will be subject to a PCR test and a serology test upon arrival.<sup>1</sup>

#### 11. What if I test positive for COVID-19 in China?

If tested positive for COVID-19 in China, the traveller will be accorded the necessary medical treatment by the local government at his/her cost.

#### 12. I have completely recovered from COVID-19, but may still test positive on the post-arrival serology test in China. May I still travel to China?

The Chinese authorities require a traveller to test negative for both the post-arrival PCR test and serology test before the traveller can proceed with his/her travel plans in China.

### **Pre-Departure in Singapore**

#### 13. What documentation do I need to present to the airline staff at check-in before I will be allowed to board a flight from Singapore to China?

Minimally, a traveller should have on hand his/her negative COVID-19 PCR test result, a valid visa and a Letter of Invitation issued by the Chinese provincial/municipal authorities of Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin or Zhejiang specifically for essential business or official travel under the fast lane.

As the specific requirements may vary amongst provinces/municipalities, the traveller should verify the latest requirements with his/her local host company or government agency.

### **Health Measures in China**

#### 14. Do I need to be quarantined upon arrival in China?

After undergoing a PCR test and serology test upon arrival, the traveller must remain in a centralised quarantine area designated by the local provincial/municipal government for one to two days until the test results are released. The traveller has to bear the costs of the post-arrival tests and the one to two days’ stay in the designated location.

If the traveller tests negative for both COVID-19 tests, the host company or government agency will transport the traveller directly from the above-mentioned location designated by the local provincial/municipal government to the workplace or residence.

#### 15. What other health measures will I be subject to in China? What would qualify as a “controlled itinerary” in China?

The traveller must follow local COVID-19 prevention and control measures for the duration of his/her stay in China, including downloading the local health QR code used in the province/municipality.

The host company or government agency will supervise the itinerary of and provide private transport for the traveller for the first 14 days upon his/her arrival in China.

As the specific requirements may vary amongst provinces/municipalities, the traveller should verify the latest requirements of the provincial/municipal authorities with his/her local host company or government agency.

While a traveller no longer needs to adhere to a controlled itinerary after the first 14 days, he/she must still follow local COVID-19 prevention and control measures for the duration of his/her stay in China. As some provinces/municipalities may require the traveller to undergo additional COVID-19 test(s) before being allowed to move beyond a controlled itinerary after the first 14 days, your local host company or government agency should verify the latest requirements with the relevant local provincial/municipality authorities.

### **Returning to Singapore**

#### 16. What health measures will I be subject to upon returning to Singapore after my fast lane travel?

Singapore-based travellers returning from their travel on the Singapore-China Fast Lane will be exempted from the prevailing SHN policy applicable to incoming travellers to Singapore, without the need to appeal, if they:
- Undertake a COVID-19 PCR test at their own cost at accredited laboratories, clinics and hospitals within 48 hours prior to their departure from China, and obtain the negative test result prior to departure; and

#### Pre-Departure COVID-19 Tests in Singapore

##### Booking an appointment

##### 1. At which clinics can I take the pre-departure Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test?

Pre-departure COVID-19 PCR tests for fast lane arrangements may only be performed at [selected clinics](/pre-departure-test) for eligible fast lane travellers.

Please call the clinic to make an appointment and verify your eligibility to be swabbed, before proceeding for the swab. Pre-departure swabs may not be performed if you do not have an appointment or are unable to produce proof of eligibility.

##### 2.	What is the latest I have to be at the clinic, based on my departure flight timing?

You should make an appointment that fits your required testing window, and be present at the clinic early for the appointment.

You must be present at least 2 hours prior to, and no later than, the stipulated cut-off timing in the table below. Travellers who do not adhere to this cut-off timing will **not** be able to obtain the results in time for departure.

| Flight departure time | Latest Cut-off Test Timing |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 12:00am to 9:29am | 10.00am two calendar days before flight |
| 9:30am to 3:29pm | 4:00pm two calendar days before flight |
| 3.30pm to 11.59pm | 10:00am the day before flight |

*Example:*
*If a traveller’s departure flight time for China is 12pm on 20 August, the required test must be done within 48 hours of departure, i.e., the traveller should take the test from 12pm on 18 August onwards, until the cut-off timing at 4pm on 18 August.*

##### 3. How can I make an appointment for pre-departure PCR testing?

For fast lane travel to China, the pre-departure PCR test must be done within 48 hours prior to departure.

Please call the clinic and book your test slot before the Cut-Off Test Timing in the schedule above. This is to ensure that you will have sufficient time to meet the fast lane requirements.

##### 4. How far in advance should I make an appointment for the pre-departure PCR test?

Due to limited slots, please make your appointment with the clinic **as early as possible**, once your flight timing and your fast lane application is approved.

Please refer to the **Schedule for the “Latest Cut-off Test Timing” and book your test slot within the indicated timing**. This is to ensure that you meet the fast lane requirements.

If you do not make a prior appointment, please note that:
1. There is no guarantee that there will be a test slot for you; and
2. You may not get your results in time for your flight to qualify for fast lane arrangements.

Travellers who miss the cut-off test timing will <u>not</u> be able to obtain a test result in time for their flight.

##### 5. What details will I need to book an appointment for the PCR test?

Please have the following information on hand when making an appointment for your test:
1. Identity card number or passport number
2. Departure flight timing
3. Required test window based on your destination country
4. Possible times for your test slot: Please refer to the Test Schedule to confirm your timing
5. Address in Singapore
6. Contact number
7. Email address

##### 6. What documents should I bring for my appointment?

Please bring the following:
1. Identity card or passport
2. Letter from the PRC Embassy confirming that you have been granted approval by the relevant authorities in China to travel to China under the Singapore-China Fast Lane
3. Softcopy booking reference showing your departure flight timing

##### Testing

##### 7. What if I miss my test timing? What if I take my test after the Cut-off Test Timing?

Travellers who miss the Cut-off Test Timing will not be able to obtain a test result in time for their flight.

Please make arrangements early for your test slot so that you can qualify for the fast lane arrangements.

##### 8. What happens if the clinic assesses that I am unable to receive the PCR test for unforeseen circumstances?

If you are unable to receive the test, you may wish to reschedule your flight, if you still wish to tap on the fast lane arrangement.

##### Test Results

##### 9. When can I expect to get my PCR test results?

You will receive your PCR test results and memo at least three hours before your flight.

The clinic will email the results to your email address. You will need to print and bring the memo overseas yourself.
