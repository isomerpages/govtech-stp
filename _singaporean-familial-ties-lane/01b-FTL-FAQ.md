#### 8. With the STP, how long are visitors allowed to stay in Singapore?

Visitors who are granted entry into Singapore will be issued with a visit pass by ICA at the immigration checkpoints. The duration of stay in Singapore will be generally aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. While in Singapore, on a visit pass, visitors are not permitted to engage in any business, professional or paid employment activities. 

#### 9. Are visitors able to extend their duration of stay in Singapore? 

Visitors who require a longer period of stay beyond the Visit Pass granted on entry into Singapore may submit an application for extension of stay online via the ICA's [e-Service](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/extend) which allows a foreign visitor to apply for an extension of their short-term Visit Pass. The application has to be submitted at least 7 days prior to the expiry of the Visit Pass to avoid overstaying. Extension of Visit Pass will not be accepted over the counter. Each application will be considered on its own merit and there is no guarantee that an extension will be granted.
