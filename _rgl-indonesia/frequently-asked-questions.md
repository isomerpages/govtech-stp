### **A) General Queries**

#### 1.	What is SafeTravel Pass under the RGL arrangement for travel to Singapore?

The SafeTravel Pass issued under the RGL arrangement is a non-transferrable single-entry travel document. It allows a traveller to seek short-term essential business and official visit into Singapore within a stipulated week (0000 hours Monday to 2359 hours Sundays), where he/she can remain in Singapore for the duration stipulated in the visit pass issued at the immigration counters of Singapore.

#### 2. Is there a limit to the number of times I can apply for a SafeTravel Pass under the RGL arrangement?

There is no limit to the number of times a traveller can be sponsored for a SafeTravel Pass under the RGL arrangement. However, as each SafeTravel pass is only valid for single-entry into Singapore, each new entry will require a fresh application by the sponsor. While there is no cap on the number of times a traveller can be sponsored for entry under the RGL, there may be penalties in repeated cases of non-utilisation (i.e. no show). 

#### 3.	Do I need to pay to apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

No payment is required.

#### 4. I intend to visit Singapore, but I do not qualify for the Indonesia RGL. Is there another SafeTravel Pass that I apply for entry into Singapore? 

You can check <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/arriving/overview">here</a> for the available SafeTravel lanes to visit Singapore. Prospective travellers cannot apply for the SafeTravel Pass-RGL themselves; all RGL applications must be submitted by a company or government agency in Singapore via this <a href="http://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO">link</a>.

#### 5. I am a Singapore Citizen / Singapore Permanent Resident / Singapore Long-Term Pass holder who is resident in Indonesia. Am I eligible to apply for the RGL to travel from Indonesia to Singapore?

#### 6. Can I use the RGL to come to Singapore to seek medical treatment?

The RGL is only for short-term essential business and official travel, and not for seeking medical treatment. Enforcement action will be taken against travellers found to have abused the RGL to seek medical treatment in Singapore, including not being able to apply for travel under the RGL again.

Travellers who are short-term visit pass holders from other countries seeking to enter Singapore for medical treatment should apply for entry approval through their Singapore doctors.
 
#### 7. Can I use the RGL to come to Singapore for long-term work or long-term study?

The RGL is only for short-term essential business and official travel. Travellers seeking to enter Singapore for other purposes may wish to visit <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/arriving/overview">here</a> for more information on other schemes. 

#### 8.	I was recently diagnosed with COVID-19 but am scheduled to travel to Singapore. Can I still visit Singapore?

In general, travellers who are unwell should seek for immediate medical attention and defer their travels. Travellers diagnosed with <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/covid19-symptoms">COVID-19</a> less than 21 days before the scheduled date of arrival in Singapore will not be permitted travel to Singapore; airlines will deny such travellers from boarding.

#### 9.	I was approved to travel to Singapore under the RGL. Can I transit through a second country to get to Singapore? What should my travel route look like?

Indonesia RGL travellers are only allowed to travel to Singapore via a non-stop flight or ferry; transits through another country is prohibited.

RGL travellers from Indonesia are allowed to travel from other provinces in Indonesia to Jakarta or Batam, and depart for Singapore via Soekarno-Hatta International Airport or Batam Center Ferry Terminal, respectively. RGL travellers that are travelling from other provinces must also fulfil Indonesia’s requirements for domestic travel.

It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby mobile devices running the same app. Together with other digital contact tracing tools, TraceTogether’s Bluetooth proximity data has helped to reduce average contact tracing time from 4 days to less than 1.5 days.

The Bluetooth proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s phone.  If the user test positive for COVID-19, the Singapore Ministry of Health will approach the user to upload their Bluetooth proximity data for contact tracing purposes. TraceTogether app does not collect or track your GPS location data. You may read more about our [Privacy Safeguards](https://tracetogether.gov.sg/common/privacystatement/).

The app works best on phones with Android version 5.1 and above, as well as phones with iOS version 10 and above. More information on the app can be found [here](https://tracetogether.gov.sg/).

This is because the TraceTogether app data stored in your previous mobile device also needs to be retained for that duration, as set out in the [RGL Terms and Conditions](https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/rgl/terms-and-conditions).

If you change your SIM card but are still using the same mobile device, you will not need to download the TraceTogether app again.

A traveller who does not have a TraceTogether-compatible device must secure in advance the rental of a TraceTogether-compatible device prior to arrival. For more information on the rental of Trace-Together compatible devices, please visit the Changi Recommendation website [here](https://safe.menlosecurity.com/https:/www.changirecommends.com/reservation_form.aspx).

Travellers must retain the TraceTogether app with the data on their mobile devices for 14 consecutive days after departing from Singapore. This is to facilitate contact tracing if travellers are tested positive for COVID-19.

#### 33.	What is SafeEntry?

SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that logs the NRIC/FIN and mobile numbers of individuals visiting hotspots, workplaces of essential services, as well as selected public venues to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 through activities such as contact tracing and identification of COVID-19 clusters.

An existing check-in method is via scanning of a QR code at the venue with a camera phone or a QR scanner app. Hence, you are encouraged to purchase a Singapore local data SIM card, or connect your mobile phone to a Singapore local Wi-Fi network to access the form for this mode of check-in.

Alternatively, some venues allow you to complete SafeEntry by presenting your passport as identification. Establishments will assist visitors with manual SafeEntry check-in.

More information on the system can be found [here](https://www.safeentry.gov.sg/).

#### 34.	What happens if I do not comply with the terms and conditions for the SafeTravel Pass?

The Singapore Government takes a serious view of non-compliance with SafeTravel terms and conditions and prevailing health measures. Non-compliance with any of the conditions of the SafeTravel Pass may result in refusal of entry into Singapore and/or cancellation of the SafeTravel Pass. The traveller and the Host shall be jointly liable for and bear all costs incurred for the cost of repatriation, as well as cost of custody and care pending repatriation. Future SafeTravel Pass applications may also be rejected.

#### 35.	Can I visit the convenient store/shopping mall/supermarket to purchase daily necessity or business-related items? 

No, travellers should seek assistance from their Host to make the purchases on their behalf to limit the contact with the local community. Any deviation from controlled itinerary may result in the cancellation of Visit Pass.
