SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that logs the NRIC/FIN and mobile numbers of individuals visiting hotspots, workplaces of essential services, as well as selected public venues to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 through activities such as contact tracing and identification of COVID-19 clusters.

An existing check-in method is via scanning of a QR code at the venue with a camera phone or a QR scanner app. Hence, you are encouraged to purchase a Singapore local data SIM card, or connect your mobile phone to a Singapore local Wi-Fi network to access the form for this mode of check-in.

The traveller and the Host shall be jointly liable for and bear all costs incurred for the cost of repatriation, as well as cost of custody and care pending repatriation. Future SafeTravel Pass applications may also be rejected.

#### 35.	Can I visit the convenient store/shopping mall/supermarket to purchase daily necessity or business-related items? 

No, travellers should seek assistance from their Host to make the purchases on their behalf to limit the contact with the local community. Any deviation from controlled itinerary may result in the cancellation of Visit Pass.
