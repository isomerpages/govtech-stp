Travellers must enter Singapore within this stipulated week.

SafeTravel Passes will be issued on a limited basis in order to manage the risk of imported COVID-19 cases.

Please send an email to <COVID_SafeTravelEnquiries@mti.gov.sg> if you have further queries related to the SafeTravel Pass.

#### 4. How do residents in Malaysia apply for a SafeTravel Pass to travel to Singapore under the RGL? What are the steps from the time I put in an application to the time I obtain a SafeTravel Pass? How long is the processing time? What documents do I need to submit?

Residents in Malaysia seeking to travel to Singapore via the RGL must be hosted by a company or a government agency in Singapore. The host company can file the application for a SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller either directly at <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO>, or through a sponsoring government agency.<sup>1</sup>.

When applying for the SafeTravel Pass, Proof of Residency in Malaysia is required. Malaysian Citizens should present a copy of their passport for submission. Non-Malaysian Citizens who are resident in Malaysia should present a copy of their Malaysian long-term pass ID for submission. The applicant will also be required to submit the controlled itinerary for the traveller(s)’ first 14 days of stay in Singapore, which is limited to travel between places of business and accommodation, with limited contact with the community.

The application for the SafeTravel Pass will be open 2 to 5 weeks before the week of the traveller’s planned departure. The processing of the application can take up to 7 days (excluding the day of application). You are encouraged to apply for the SafeTravel Pass as early as possible, factoring in the time necessary for the processing of the SafeTravel Pass application, visa application (if needed) and taking a pre-departure COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.

When the SafeTravel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be issued to the sponsoring company / government agency by email within 3 working days. With this letter, an approved applicant who is a visa-required passport holder will proceed to apply for a visa for travel to Singapore through the usual channels (Singapore overseas missions, authorised visa agents, local contact or companies) at least 4 working days before departure. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status through <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save>.

Those who do not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. Malaysian citizens) will not need to apply for a visa for RGL travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

The approved applicant will have to submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations as well as declare his/her accommodation electronically via the SG Arrival Card (<https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/>), within 3 days prior to the date of arrival in Singapore.

Prior to the traveller’s departure from Malaysia, the sponsoring company or government agency should submit the traveller’s **certificate of negative result for COVID-19 test** taken within 72 hours before departure and **latest controlled itinerary in Singapore** at <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO>.

Travellers arriving in Singapore by air are required to present their valid SafeTravel Pass, valid visa (for visa-required passport holders), return air ticket and negative result for a COVID-19 PCR test for pre-boarding checks at the airlines’ check-in counter and immigration counter. Otherwise, he/she may be refused boarding.

Travellers arriving in Singapore via land checkpoints are required to present their valid SafeTravel Pass, valid visa (for visa-required passport holders), and negative result for COVID-19 PCR test result.

Travellers who are granted entry into Singapore are generally issued with a Visit Pass, of which the duration would be aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### 5. What are the responsibilities of the host company?

When a company is sponsoring a traveller, it will have to be responsible for the application of the SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller as well as the timely submission of the accompanying documents.

The host company should also ensure that the traveller abides by the terms and conditions of the Singapore-Malaysia RGL, and the prevailing health measures during his/her stay in Singapore. Authorities may ask for proof of adherence, including physical verification or SafeEntry Pass records (e.g. screenshots), to the controlled itinerary and other terms and conditions when the traveller is in Singapore.

You can access the terms and conditions of the Singapore-Malaysia RGL at <https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/malaysia/rgl/terms-and-conditions>. Actions will be taken against the traveller and the host company in the event of non-compliance.

If the traveller’s SafeTravel Pass has expired, he/she should submit a new application.

#### 10. What visa will I be eligible for under the RGL, and what is the duration of stay that I will be eligible for in Singapore?

Every application for a visa, including the type of visa granted, will be considered on its own merits and subject to approval. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/ she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status through <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save>.

Those who do not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. Malaysian citizens) will not need to apply for a visa for RGL travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s phone, and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19.
