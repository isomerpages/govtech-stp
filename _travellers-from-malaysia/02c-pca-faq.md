### **General**

#### 1. What is the Periodic Commuting Arrangement?

The Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) is a scheme agreed between Singapore and Malaysia to allow work and business-related travel between the two countries via the land border crossings at the Johor-Singapore Causeway and Malaysia-Singapore Second Link. Under the PCA, Malaysia Citizens and Malaysia Permanent Residents who are Singapore work pass holders are permitted to enter Singapore and should reside in Singapore for at least 90 days.

#### 2. What is the rationale for imposing a daily quota? Is there a webpage for me to check if the daily quota has been maximised?  Are there any plans to revise the daily quota in the future?

The quota is imposed to stagger and manage the volume of daily entrants via our land crossings. This mitigates the extent of crowds and congestion. It also allows swab operations to be conducted more smoothly, without overwhelming our public health system. While companies applying for the PCA are unable to check for the available quota, they will be alerted during registration if the quota has been maximised. Depending on the demand for PCA, the quota may be revised in future.

### **For Singapore Citizens/Permanent Residents**

#### 3. I am a Malaysian citizen and a Singapore PR. I am currently in Malaysia, but I want to return to Singapore. Do I need the PCA to return to Singapore?

If you are a Singapore PR with a valid Re-Entry Permit, you may return to Singapore without the need for any entry approval. However, you will be subject to the prevailing Stay-Home Notice requirements after arriving in Singapore. You may wish to refer to [www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19](https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19) for details and updates on border control measures as well as [www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19/shn](https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19/shn) for information on the prevailing health measures for Singapore Citizens and PRs returning from abroad.

#### 4. I am a Singapore Citizen who is currently in Malaysia. Do I need the PCA to return to Singapore?

For Singapore citizens, you <u><b>do not</b></u> need any entry approval to return to Singapore. However, you will be subject to the prevailing Stay-Home Notice requirements after arriving in Singapore. You may wish to refer to [www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19](https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19) for details and updates on border control measures, as well as [www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19/shn](https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19/shn) for more information about SHN issued by ICA.

#### 5. I am a Malaysian citizen and a Singapore PR. I am currently in Singapore but I want to return to Malaysia. Do I need the PCA to return to Malaysia?

Entry into Malaysia is governed by the Malaysian authorities. You may wish to reach out to the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs ([www.kln.gov.my](https://www.kln.gov.my)), the Malaysian Immigration Department ([www.imi.gov.my](https://www.imi.gov.my)) or the Malaysian High Commission in Singapore (<https://www.kln.gov.my/web/sgp_singapore>) for further advice.

#### 6. I am a Singapore Citizen/PR holding a Malaysia Work Pass. I am currently based in Singapore and I wish to return to Malaysia for business and work purposes. Can I use the PCA to return to Malaysia?

Yes, you may use the PCA to return to Malaysia. If your trip to Malaysia is less than 14 days, you may use the RGL.

Information on entering Malaysia is available on the Malaysian Immigration Department’s webpage (<https://www.imi.gov.my/portal2017/index.php/ms/sumber-dan-arkib/pengumuman/1833-Malaysia-Singapore-border-crossing-arrangement.html>)

For further advice and details, you may wish to reach out to the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs ([www.kln.gov.my](https://www.kln.gov.my)), the Malaysian Immigration Department ([www.imi.gov.my](https://www.imi.gov.my)) or the Malaysian High Commission in Singapore ([www.kln.gov.my/web/sgp_Singapore](https://www.kln.gov.my/web/sgp_Singapore)).

### **Application**

#### 7. Can I apply for the PCA for my employee to enter Malaysia on this application platform?

No. This PCA application platform is intended for Singapore-based companies who require their Malaysia employees to return to Singapore for work.

For details on the application procedures and requirements for Singapore Citizens and PRs to enter Malaysia under the PCA, please visit the Immigration Department of Malaysia's website at <https://www.imi.gov.my/portal2017/index.php/ms/sumber-dan-arkib/pengumuman/1833-malaysia-singapore-border-crossing-arrangement.html>. For queries related to entering Malaysia under the PCA, please approach the Immigration Department of Malaysia.

#### 8. What are the steps from the time an application is put in, to the time the result of the PCA application is received? How long is the processing time? What information/documents need to be submitted for the PCA application?

Individuals are not permitted to apply for PCA. Singapore-based companies have to apply for the PCA on behalf of their employees to enter Singapore for work. The company has to submit the PCA application using their CorpPass at the PCA application platform. Applications for the PCA can be made up to 60 days prior to the intended date of entry.

Upon successful application under the PCA, an email will be sent to the point of contact provided by the company in the application.

#### 9. I am unable to log in with my CorpPass.

Please ensure that you are using a CorpPass administrator account to log in to the Safe Travel Portal.

Please search for ‘Safe Travel Portal’ under the e-service catalogue.

#### 10. Is the PCA approval of my employee transferrable?

No. An approval is given to a specific employee and therefore cannot be transferred.

Should another employee require to enter Singapore under PCA, a separate application must be submitted.

#### 11. Can the family member of my employee who holds a Dependant’s Pass or Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) enter Singapore with my employee, if my employee receives an approved PCA application?

No. The PCA is intended to facilitate business/work-related travels, and therefore would not cover individuals who are dependants. Please apply for an [entry approval with MOM](http://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-to-bring-pass-holders-into-singapore).

#### 12. My employee has an in-principle approval or Letter of Consent (LOC), can I apply for PCA?

No. Please apply for an [entry approval with MOM](http://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-to-bring-pass-holders-into-singapore). Those on LTVPs issued by ICA need to request for [ICA’s entry approval](https://www.ica.gov.sg/), even if they have LOCs issued by MOM.

#### 13. Can I apply for a PCA if my employee is entering Singapore from Malaysia via air or sea?

No. Please apply for an [entry approval with MOM](http://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-to-bring-pass-holders-into-singapore).

#### 14. Do I need to pay to apply for PCA on behalf of my employees?

Payment (via credit card) for the mandatory COVID-19 PCR test for each employee is required upfront at the point of application. Employers/employees should expect to pay up to S$200 (inclusive of GST) per employee for the COVID-19 PCR test.

#### 15. What is the duration of stay in Singapore that my employee will be eligible for under PCA?  Can I extend the PCA period for my employee?

The duration of stay in Singapore is tied to the validity of the employee’s long-term work pass for business and work.

Should the employee leave Singapore, employers will only be able to apply for a new PCA for their employee to re-enter Singapore 90 days after the date of his/her prior entry.

#### 16. Can my employee use the PCA to come to Singapore for study, short-term work, or leisure purposes?

No. The PCA application is only for travellers holding a valid long-term work pass in Singapore for business and work purposes.

Yes, a new application is required each time your employee wants to enter Singapore.

#### 18. I am a confinement nanny. Can I apply for a PCA to enter Singapore?

No. Please get your employer to apply for an [entry approval with MOM](http://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-confinement-nanny/covid-19-precautionary-measures-for-confinement-nannies).

### **SHN Measures**

#### 29. I am a Singapore Citizen/PR under the Malaysia-issued PCA who wants to return to Singapore on short-term home leave. How do I apply for a SHN waiver?

Singapore Citizens/PRs under the Malaysia-issued PCA (i.e. holders of PCA MYTravelPass) can apply to take a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival at Woodlands Checkpoint or Tuas Checkpoint at their own cost, in lieu of Stay-Home Notice (SHN), when returning to Singapore for short-term home leave. You may apply for a SHN waiver [here](https://form.gov.sg/#!/5f2140ab27ed400012c8edfc).

#### 30. Is cohorting allowed for Stay-Home-Notice (SHN)?

Yes. Cohorting is allowed for up to four pax, provided that the employees arrive in Singapore on the same day.

#### 31. Where can my employees serve their Stay-Home Notice (SHN)?

Employees are only allowed to serve their SHN in hotels, serviced apartments, or single-occupancy residences (i.e. if there is only one employee in the entire SHN accommodation). However, an exception can be made for employees who are serving their SHN in premises occupied by immediate family members (i.e. parents, siblings, spouse and children), or employees who are cohorting (up to four pax) provided that the employees arrive in Singapore on the same day. Employees are prohibited from serving their SHN at a dormitory, hostel or rented room.

#### 32. May I serve my Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at a family member or relatives’ house?

Your SHN place of residence must fulfil the prevailing SHN advisory and guidelines. To curb community spread, you are allowed to serve your SHN only in premises occupied by immediate family members (i.e. parents, siblings, spouse and children). You may refer to MOH’s website (<http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19>) for the latest updates.

#### 33. What are the accommodation arrangements for Stay-Home Notice (SHN)? Will the Government be paying for the hotel/accommodation for SHN? Is there a list of pre-approved hotels?

The Singapore Government will not arrange or bear the costs of an employee’s accommodation for the SHN. The employer/employee is expected to arrange and bear the costs of the employee’s accommodation for the SHN.

There is no list of pre-approved hotels for SHN. If you wish to serve your SHN in a hotel, you may do so in a hotel of your choice. Please indicate to the properties you approach that you/your employee will be serving SHN.

#### 34. What should I do if I am feeling unwell on the date of my COVID-19 PCR swab appointment?

If you are feeling unwell on the day of your COVID-19 PCR swab appointment, <b><u>do not proceed to the appointed test site</u></b>. Please refer to the following link for the terms and conditions of your swab appointment, including the available means to seek appropriate medical attention: <https://go.gov.sg/tc>.

### **Health Measures**

#### 35. Are there any materials I can disseminate to my employees to prepare them for their SHN and COVID-19 test in Singapore?

For more information on the SHN guidelines in Singapore, you may refer to <https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/frequently-asked-questions/loa-shn-matters>.

### **Testing Arrangements**

#### 36. What is the procedure for the COVID-19 PCR test and how long will it take?

There will be four stations at the COVID-19 PCR test site, comprising (i) holding area, (ii) registration, (iii) swabbing and (iv) discharge. The entire process from the first to last station will take approximately an hour, while the COVID-19 PCR test itself will take approximately 6 minutes.

#### 37. How is the COVID-19 PCR test appointment arranged, and who will be informed of the appointment details?

Your employee is required to undergo a COVID-19 PCR test on the 5th day of his/her SHN period. An SMS message and email notification will be sent to the employer/employee by the 3rd day of the employee’s SHN period. The notification will indicate the employee’s test date, time of test and designated test site for the COVID-19 PCR test. Employers are then expected to inform their employees of the appointment details.

If the employee/employer does not receive a notification containing the details of the employee’s COVID-19 PCR test date, time and designated test site <u>by the 3rd day</u> of the employee’s SHN period, please contact us at <COVID_SafeTravelEnquiries@mti.gov.sg> with the employee’s name and FIN, as well as your mobile number. 

#### 38. My employee is unable to go for his/her COVID-19 test on the scheduled date. Who can I contact to reschedule a new swab appointment?

The employee is expected to strictly adhere to his/her appointment timing for his/her COVID-19 PCR test. It will be a breach of the Infectious Disease Act if he/she does not undergo the COVID-19 PCR test. Please note that the employee can only exit his/her SHN if the test result is negative, whichever is later.

#### 39. Can I go for my COVID-19 PCR test at a different time slot?

No. You are required to turn up at the COVID-19 PCR test site at your assigned timeslot.

#### 40. If I have done a swab test/recovered from COVID-19 in the past, do I still need to do a test in Singapore?

All PCA travellers are required to follow existing COVID-19 PCR test and SHN procedures, unless advised otherwise. We will only notify travellers who qualify for exemptions within 3 days from their entry into Singapore.

#### 41. If I am unable to do the nasal COVID-19 PCR test due to certain medical conditions (i.e. frequent nose bleeds, operations on face or nose area, tumours or cancers of the nose or throat area, facial or skull fractures), can I inform anybody before I am scheduled for the COVID-19 PCR test?

#### 42. If I do not have my work pass, what can I bring to validate my identity at the COVID-19 PCR test site?

The employee must bring a digital copy of their Singapore-issued work pass and his/her passport to validate their identity.

If the employee has lost his/her work pass, they should first make an official police report. On the day of the COVID-19 PCR test, he/she should bring along the police report (which must include his/her FIN no.) and passport to validate his/her identity.

#### 43. How do I make payment for the COVID-19 PCR test? How much does a COVID-19 PCR test cost?

Payment for the mandatory COVID-19 PCR test for each employee is required at the point of application and must be made via credit card. Employers/employees should expect to pay up to S$200 (inclusive of GST) per employee for the COVID-19 PCR test.

#### 44. What COVID-19 tests will my employee be subject to upon arrival in Singapore? How will I and/or my employee be informed of his/her COVID-19 test result?

The employee under the PCA is required to undergo a COVID-19 PCR test on the assigned date of swabbing before the end of his/her SHN period. The point of contact provided by the employer will receive an email and SMS message indicating their employee’s test date, time of test and designated test site for the COVID-19 PCR test.

COVID-19 PCR test results will be sent to employers <u>within 2 days</u> of the test. Should there be a need for a second test, employers will be informed. While awaiting test results, individuals should continue to observe the SHN period in his/her declared SHN residence.

If the employer does not receive a notification containing the results of the employee’s COVID-19 PCR test results <u>within 2 days</u> of the test, please contact us at <COVID_SafeTravelEnquiries@mti.gov.sg> with the employee’s name and FIN, as well as your mobile number.

#### 45. Can my employee take public transport to travel from the declared SHN accommodation to the designated test site for his/her COVID-19 PCR test?

No. The employee should not take public transport (buses and trains) for any purpose during their SHN period, including travelling to/from his/her declared place of residence for SHN and the designated test site for his/her COVID-19 PCR test.

The employee may <u>only</u> take the following modes of transport:
1. Personal transport
2. Private buses that only ferry Malaysia passengers who are serving SHN; or
3. Taxis and private-hire cars hired from dedicated taxi hotlines or ride-hail applications with a clear indication provided on his/her SHN status.

The employee is also required to travel <u>directly</u> from the declared SHN place of residence to the designated test site, and back to the declared SHN place of residence from the test site, without stopping at any other destination along the journey.

#### 46. Can my employee hail a taxi from the street while travelling in Singapore during the SHN period?

No. The employee should only use dedicated taxi hotlines (provided below) or ride-hail applications to hire the taxis or private hire cars.
