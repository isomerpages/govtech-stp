### **Attention**
Singapore Citizens/PRs <b><u>do not</u></b> need the PCA to return to Singapore. However, you will be subject to the prevailing Stay-Home Notice requirements after arriving in Singapore. You may wish to refer to [www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19](https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19) for details and updates on border control measures, as well as [www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19/shn](https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19/shn) for more information about SHN issued by ICA.

For Malaysian citizens and Malaysia PRs who want to return to Malaysia, your entry into Malaysia is governed by the Malaysian authorities. You may wish to reach out to the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs ([www.kln.gov.my](https://www.kln.gov.my)), the Malaysian Immigration Department ([www.imi.gov.my](https://www.imi.gov.my)) or the Malaysian High Commission in Singapore (<https://www.kln.gov.my/web/sgp_singapore>) for further advice.

The Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) is a scheme agreed between Singapore and Malaysia to allow work and business-related travel between the two countries via the land border crossings at the Johor-Singapore Causeway and Malaysia-Singapore Second Link. Under the PCA, Malaysia Citizens and Malaysia Permanent Residents (PRs) with valid Singapore work passes should remain in Singapore for at least 90 days before returning to Malaysia for home leave. The entry and exit between Singapore and Malaysia must be via Woodlands Checkpoint or Tuas Checkpoint in Singapore. Work pass holders approved under the PCA scheme will serve at least 7-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) and undertake a COVID-19 PCR test.

Singapore-based companies that wish to apply for the PCA for their employees may submit their applications from 10 August 2020, 1200 hours onwards at <https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/malaysia/pca/apply-now>.

## **Process Overview**

### **Application Process**

The PCA application has to be submitted by the employer on behalf of their employees from 10 August 2020, 1200 hours onwards. Employers may choose a date of entry within a 60-day window of their application. All applications will be processed on a first-come, first-served basis. Employers must submit their applications at least 7 calendar days before their employees’ entry into Singapore.

Employers are advised to have the following information of each employee on hand, before proceeding to submit an application:
1. Employee’s FIN;
2. Expiry Date of Employee’s Work Pass;
3. Employee’s Intended Date of Entry into Singapore;
4. Address of Employee’s Accommodation to complete His/Her Stay-Home Notice (SHN)<sup>*</sup>; and
5. Details of Contact Person in Company (e.g. Name, Mobile Number, Email Address)

<sup>*</sup><u>IMPORTANT:</u> Employees are only allowed to serve their SHN in hotels, serviced apartments, or single-occupancy residences (i.e. if there is only one employee in the entire SHN accommodation). However, an exception can be made for employees who are serving their SHN in premises occupied by immediate family members (i.e. parents, siblings, spouse and children), or employees who are cohorting (up to four pax) provided that the employees arrive in Singapore on the same day. Employees are prohibited from serving their SHN at a dormitory, hostel or rented room. There is no list of pre-approved hotels for SHN. If employees wish to serve their SHN in a hotel, they may do so in a hotel of their choice. Please indicate to the properties you approach that you/your employee will be serving SHN.

Applications will only be processed after payment for the COVID-19 PCR test has been made. Payment must be made via credit card. An email alert will be sent to the employer through the contact provided if the PCA application for their employee is successful. The employer will also be informed of the details for their employee’s COVID-19 PCR test.

### **Pre-departure from Malaysia**

#### Prior to Arrival

Prior to arrival at the immigration checkpoints, employees approved under the PCA are required to:
- Monitor their health status and refrain from travelling to Singapore if feeling unwell;
- Ensure that they enter Singapore on their approved date as stated in their application and PCA approval email;
- Ensure that they complete the electronic Health Declaration Card (eHDC) at <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard>;
- Ensure that they download the *TraceTogether, Homer* and *WhatsApp* mobile applications on their mobile phone; and
- Bring along their passport and work pass when entering Singapore.
- Please ensure that your employee has a copy (electronic or hardcopy) of the PCA approval letter, which may be required as proof during immigration clearance at Malaysia's checkpoint.

Employees approved under the PCA can commute from Malaysia’s immigration checkpoint to Singapore via personal transport, via private buses that only ferry Malaysian passengers who will be serving SHN, or by foot.

<sup>*</sup><u>IMPORTANT:</u> Vehicle Entry Permit (VEP) fees will apply throughout the period of stay in Singapore for all personal transport modes. <b><u>The VEP fees are S$35/day for cars and S$4/day for motorcycles.</u></b> To avoid accumulating your VEP fees, you are encouraged to pay your VEP fees regularly at any of the 810 AXS stations located across Singapore (payment by Singapore bank-issued ATM and credit cards only). Please click here for more information about VEP payment methods.

### **Arrival in Singapore**

#### Post-Arrival Measures

After immigration, employees will have to take their personal transport (e.g. motorbikes), private buses that only ferry Malaysian passengers who are serving SHN<sup>*</sup>, or taxis and private-hire cars directly from the immigration checkpoint to the declared SHN accommodation, without stopping at any other destination along the journey. They will need to identify themselves as a person/persons subject to a SHN when making the booking and when boarding the vehicle. When travelling in the taxi or private-hire car, they should sit alone in the back seat (if alone) and could sit together as 3 people in the back seats (family or individuals serving SHN at the same facility), with windows down and the air-conditioning turned off. The employee should not take public trains or buses or flag down a taxi while serving the SHN. Enforcement action may be taken if the employee is found to have not adhered to the transport advisory.

<sup>*</sup><u>IMPORTANT:</u> Malaysian bus drivers are to <u><b>return immediately</b></u> to Malaysia after dropping off employees under the PCA scheme at their declared SHN accommodation. We will not hesitate to take disciplinary action against parties who do not comply with the above requirements.

The employee must remain in the declared SHN accommodation for at least 7 days from the date of entry into Singapore and test negative for COVID-19, whichever is later.

The employee will only be permitted to leave his/her declared place of residence for SHN to the designated testing facility for his/her COVID-19 PCR test on the assigned date and appointment time of swabbing. The employee is required to bring along and present his/her work pass and a copy of the COVID-19 PCR test confirmation email/SMS for his/her COVID-19 PCR test. The employee must return immediately to his/her declared place of residence for SHN after the test.

An SMS message and email notification will be sent to the employer/employee by the 3rd day of the employee’s SHN period. The notification will indicate the employee’s test date, time of test and designated test site for the COVID-19 PCR test. It is the  responsibility of the employer/contact person of the company to ensure that the employee goes for the COVID-19 PCR tests. The employee is prohibited from using public buses and trains for this purpose. Only personal transport, company transport, or taxis/private-hire vehicles booked via dedicated hotlines are allowed.

Once the employee has served his/her SHN and tested negative for COVID-19, the employee can commence work. If tested positive for COVID-19, the employee will undergo medical treatment. Charges for COVID-19 treatment for Work Pass Holders on permitted travel arrangements will apply. The employee should furnish the relevant supporting documents to indicate his/her status as a PCA traveller, which would allow them to tap on prevailing financial arrangements (e.g. foreign worker insurance) to fund the cost of treatment, if applicable.

The employer/employee will bear the costs of the employee’s accommodation for the SHN and post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test in Singapore, subject to prevailing MOM requirements.

#### Measures during stay in Singapore

The employee will be required to abide by prevailing local public health requirements and safe distancing measures throughout his/her entire stay in Singapore.

The employee will be required to act on MOM’s SMS, which will be sent within 1 to 3 days of his/her arrival, asking him/her to download the *Homer* mobile application and register his/her mobile number. The employee must have a thermometer to take and report his/her temperature 3 times a day using the Homer app.

The employee will be allowed to use public transportation only after completing their SHN period and having tested negative for COVID-19.

Employees without an entry approval under the PCA or other channels will be refused entry into Singapore.
