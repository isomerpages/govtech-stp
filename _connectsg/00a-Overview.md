The Connect@Singapore initiative was announced on 15 December 2020 as part of Singapore’s efforts to re-open our borders in a controlled and safe manner. This aims to facilitate essential business exchanges in the COVID-19 environment. 

Under this scheme, a limited number of business, official and high economic value travellers from all countries will be able to enter Singapore for short-term stays of up to 14 days. For the entire duration of their stay, these travellers will be housed in a “bubble” within the appointed facilities. Travellers will have to present a valid negative COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test prior to leaving their home country, and obtain a negative result for a PCR test that is administered on arrival in Singapore. They will also undergo regular Antigen Rapid Tests (ART) and are required to strictly observe all prevailing Safe Management Measures during their stay. 

Appointment of the Connect@Singapore facilities is ongoing. Facility operators interested in participating in the Connect@Singapore initiative may submit their proposals through the Singapore Tourism Board no later than 31 December 2020.
