### Travel Checklist – Category (I) Travel History

This checklist is suitable **only** for travellers with travel and transit history to any Category (I) country/region in the past 14 days before arrival in Singapore. Return to [this menu](/shn-and-swab-summary) if you are unsure if you come under this travel history category. Travellers arriving in Singapore via the Work Pass Holder General Lane, Air Travel Pass, Periodic Commuting Arrangement, Reciprocal Green Lane, Vaccinated Travel Lane or Death and Critical Illness Emergency Lane should only refer to the lane specific requirements or their approval letters for instructions. 

Travellers may print out this page and indicate with a **"&#9745;"** in the box **(&#9744;)** for completed activities.

### Stage 1: Pre-Departure for Singapore

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Application for Entry Approval</b></i>

All travellers, except Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, must apply for entry approval to enter Singapore using a SafeTravel Lane. Details on the appropriate lane to use to enter Singapore can be accessed via the [“Travelling to Singapore”](/arriving/overview) page.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) Application for Entry Visas</b></i>

Valid entry-visa holders and visa-exempted travellers are not required to apply for an entry visa to enter Singapore. Travellers who are unsure if they require an entry-visa or wish to apply for a visa may click [here](https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-depart/entry_requirements/visa_requirements) for more information.

&#9744;  <i><b>C) Submission of Health Declaration</b></i>

Up to 72 hours before arrival in Singapore, travellers should submit an [SG Arrival Card](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/) (SGAC) with their pre-trip health and travel history declaration here. Travellers should **defer their travels** if they meet any of the following conditions:

</ol>


### Stage 2: Departure for Singapore

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Pre-boarding Document Checks</b></i>

As part of the airline or transport operator’s pre-boarding checks, travellers who are not a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident may be asked to produce their valid Entry Approval Letter. This is to ensure that the traveller has been approved for entry into Singapore.

### Stage 3: Arrival in Singapore

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Immigration Clearance</b></i>

You must present yourself for immigration clearance at a point of entry into Singapore. You must satisfy the basic entry requirements before you can be considered for entry. The period of stay granted wil be shown on the visit pass endorsement given on your passport. Please note that from <b><u>10 Oct 2021</u></b>, all foreign visitors arriving in Singapore <b><u>via air</u></b> will be notified digitally of their Visit Pass (e-Pass) through email. There will not be any physical endorsement on your passport. The e-Pass notification will indicate the period of stay granted and last day of stay allowed. Please ensure that you provide a valid email address when submitting the SG Arrival Card to ensure that you receive the e-Pass. Click <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/public-education/electronic-visit-pass-(e-pass)-replaces-inked-endorsements-for-foreign-visitors-arriving-in-singapore-via-air-checkpoints">here</a> for more information about the e-Pass.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) COVID-19 Tests</b></i>

Take an on-arrival [COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest#price) test. If you did not [pay for the test before arrival](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest#price), you will pay on the spot but can expect additional delays in the administration of the test and departure from the checkpoint.

&#9744;  <i><b>C) Transport to Declared Self-Isolation Accommodation</b></i>

The use of public transport (e.g. trains, buses, street-hailed taxis) is prohibited. Travellers will commute directly to their declared SHN accommodation using their own private vehicle, or pre-booked taxi/private hire car with any of the following transport operators:

### Stage 4: Self-isolation

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Serve self-isolation period</b></i>

Travellers may self-isolate in the following accommodations:
- Place of residence; or 
- Hotel of choice.

Travellers without a suitable place of residence may [self-isolate](https://sha.org.sg/air-travel-pass) at a hotel found in this [non-exhaustive list](https://sha.org.sg/hotel-accommodation). Before a booking is made, travellers should check and ensure that the hotel can accommodate guests who are self-isolating for their COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR Test”) result. During this period of self-isolation, the traveller is prohibited from leaving their accommodations.

### Stage 5: End of Self-isolation period

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Release from self-isolation</b></i>

Travellers may only leave their accommodation only **after** a negative result of the COVID-19 test taken on arrival in Singapore is conveyed. The result could be released to the traveller via a call, email, or SMS. Travellers with Singpass may also view their results via the [HealthHub App](https://www.healthhub.sg/HealtheServices). 

Travellers who test positive for COVID-19 will and must receive [medical treatment](/health/covidtreatment). The prevailing treatment charges will apply.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) Advisory on prevailing COVID-19 management in Singapore</b></i>

After self-isolation, travellers may go about their activities but **must** comply with the latest public health measures. This includes the use of the [TraceTogether app](https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/), which allows the identification of close contacts of a positive COVID-19 case. For the latest measures visit the Ministry of Health [website](https://moh.gov.sg/covid-19-phase-advisory) for more details.

Some activities in Singapore may require proof of vaccination (e.g. attendance at large scale events, dining restrictions). If you had been vaccinated overseas, click [here](/health/vtsg) for details on whether you qualify, and how to receive local recognition of your vaccinated status.
