<i>Readers who have arrived on this page directly from a search engine or are new to the entry-requirements imposed by Singapore during the pandemic, should start from the <a href="/arriving/overview">“Travelling to Singapore”</a> page. Travellers who do not meet the entry requirements may be turned away from Singapore. </i>

### Travel Checklist – Category (III) Travel History

This checklist is suitable **only** for travellers with travel and transit history to any Category (III) country/region in the past 14 days before arrival in Singapore. Return to [this menu](/shn-and-swab-summary) if you are unsure if you come under this travel history category. Travellers arriving in Singapore via the Work Pass Holder General Lane, Air Travel Pass, Periodic Commuting Arrangement, Reciprocal Green Lane, Vaccinated Travel Lane or Death and Critical Illness Emergency Lane should only refer to the lane specific requirements or their approval letters for instructions. 

Travellers may print out this page and indicate with a **"&#9745;"** in the box **(&#9744;)** for completed activities.

### Stage 1: Pre-Departure for Singapore

<div id="stage1a"></div>

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Application for Entry Approval</b></i>

All travellers, except Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, must apply for entry approval to enter Singapore using a SafeTravel Lane. Details on the appropriate lane to use to enter Singapore can be accessed via the [“Travelling to Singapore”](/arriving/overview) page.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) Application for Entry Visas</b></i>

Valid entry-visa holders and visa-exempted travellers are not required to apply for an entry visa to enter Singapore. Travellers who are unsure if they require an entry-visa or wish to apply for a visa may click [here](https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-depart/entry_requirements/visa_requirements) for more information.

&#9744;  <i><b>C) Pre-Departure COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (PDT)</b></i>

Travellers must take a PDT **within 48 hours before departure** for Singapore, unless they:
- Below the age of three in this calendar year; or
- Have remained in any [Category (I) country/region](/shn-and-swab-summary) in the past 14 consecutive days before departure; or
- Are Singapore Citizen entering Singapore via the Causeway or Second Link.

Travellers are required to take their PDT at an [accredited or authorised testing facility](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/accreditation-bodies-for-covid-19-testing) in the country/region of departure and ensure that the PDT:
- Is in English (or accompanied with an English translation);
- Contains the traveller's name, and Date of Birth or Passport number (per the passport used to travel to Singapore); and
- Reflects the date and result of the PCR test.

Travellers with difficulties getting a COVID-19 PCR test before their departure can contact the Safe Travel Office [here](/contact-us).

&#9744;  <i><b>D) Submission of Health Declaration</b></i>

Up to 72 hours before arrival in Singapore, travellers should submit an [SG Arrival Card](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/) (SGAC) with their pre-trip health and travel history declaration here. Travellers should **defer their travels** if they meet any of the following conditions: 

<ol style="font-size:18px; margin-bottom:0px; list-style-type:lower-roman">
	<li style="font-size:18px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Showing COVID-19 symptoms</li>
		<li style="font-size:18px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Are diagnosed or suspected to have contracted COVID-19 in the last 14 days before departing for Singapore; or</li>
		<li style="font-size:18px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Had been in close contact with a COVID-19 positive patient in the last 10 days before departing for Singapore. This includes the provision of care for a COVID-19 patient in a healthcare or family/social setting, staying in the same location as a COVID-19 positive patient, or had been in close (i.e. less than two meters) contact with a COVID-19 patient for more than 15 minutes.</li>
</ol>

&#9744;  <i><b>E) Registration and Pre-payment for On-Arrival COVID-19 Test and Installation of TraceTogether app</b></i>

Travellers who are fit for travel should:

<ol style="font-size:18px; margin-bottom:0px; list-style-type:lower-roman">
	<li style="font-size:18px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Register and pre-pay for their on-arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test:<ol style="font-size:18px; list-style-type:disc;">

</ol>

<div id="1F"></div>

&#9744;  <i><b>F) Request for alternative Stay-Home Notice (SHN) arrangements</b></i>

Travellers will, **by default**, serve their Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at an assigned hotel. Such hotels are also known as SHN-Dedicated Facility (SDF). Due to fast-changing SDF demands, travellers would not be informed of their assigned hotel before arrival in Singapore.

Exceptions to the norm, i.e. completing SHN at the traveller’s own residence, will be considered for special cases below. Unless otherwise indicated, all applications must be submitted **at least three working days before arrival** in Singapore.

  </table>

Travellers should note that any prior approvals given to complete the SHN at a place of residence may be rescinded should the public health risk assessment change. In such an event, the prevailing travel health control measures would apply, i.e. serving SHN at an SDF.

### Stage 2: Departure for Singapore

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Pre-boarding Document Checks</b></i>

As part of the airline or transport operator’s pre-boarding checks, travellers may be asked for the following:
- Entry approval letter (only for travellers who are not a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident); and
- Valid Pre-Departure COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (PDT) showing a negative COVID-19 result

Travellers without the above may be denied boarding.


### Stage 3: Arrival in Singapore

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Immigration Clearance</b></i>

You must present yourself for immigration clearance at a point of entry into Singapore. You must satisfy the basic entry requirements before you can be considered for entry. The period of stay granted wil be shown on the visit pass endorsement given on your passport. Please note that from <b><u>10 Oct 2021</u></b>, all foreign visitors arriving in Singapore <b><u>via air</u></b> will be notified digitally of their Visit Pass (e-Pass) through email. There will not be any physical endorsement on your passport. The e-Pass notification will indicate the period of stay granted and last day of stay allowed. Please ensure that you provide a valid email address when submitting the SG Arrival Card to ensure that you receive the e-Pass. Click <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/public-education/electronic-visit-pass-(e-pass)-replaces-inked-endorsements-for-foreign-visitors-arriving-in-singapore-via-air-checkpoints">here</a> for more information about the e-Pass.

As part of immigration clearance, travellers will be asked for their PDT report showing a negative COVID-19 result. Failing which, they may be turned away, and/or have their entry/re-entry or work-related permits and passes cancelled. 

&#9744;  <i><b>B) COVID-19 Tests</b></i>

Take an on-arrival [COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest#price) test. If you did not [pay for the test before arrival](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest#price), you will pay on the spot but can expect additional delays in the administration of the test and departure from the checkpoint.

&#9744;  <i><b>C) Issuance of Stay Home Notice (SHN) </b></i>

A 10-day [Stay-Home Notice (SHN)](/health/shn) will be sent to the email address provided by the traveller in their [SGAC declaration](https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-depart/entry_requirements/sg-arrival-card). The SHN takes effect immediately on the day of its issuance.

&#9744;  <i><b>D) Transport to SHN Accommodation</b></i>

Travellers are required to commute directly from the checkpoint to the assigned Stay-Home Notice (SHN) accommodation. 

Those staying at **SHN dedicated facilities will take the government-provided transport**.

<b><a href="/health/vtsg">Fully vaccinated</a> travellers</b> who have obtained approval to serve SHN at their own accommodation may commute using their own private vehicle, or pre-book taxi/private hire car with any of the following transport operators:

The use of public transport (e.g. trains, buses, street-hailed taxis) is prohibited. Travellers must rely on the same transport options when commuting from their SHN accommodation for the COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test that is administered on the last day of SHN. 

### Stage 4: Stay-Home Notice and COVID-19 Tests

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Serve Stay-Home Notice (SHN)</b></i>

A Stay-Home Notice (SHN) comes into effect immediately upon its issuance. Travellers must remain in the SHN accommodation for the period specified in their SHN, unless they have/have been:
- Directed by the relevant authorities to do so;
- Scheduled to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR test”) at the end of the SHN period; or
- Received a negative PCR test result for the test taken on the last day of SHN.

To calculate the estimated SHN end-date, click [here](/shn-calculator) for an SHN calculator.

During the SHN period, randomised in-person or phone/video compliance check(s) will be conducted. Failure to comply with any SHN-related requirement is an offence under the Infectious Diseases Act. Errant travellers can expect to be fined, imprisoned, and/or have their residency/work permits revoked. For more information on SHN-related compliance matters, click [here](/health/shn#shn-compliance-checks).

&#9744;  <i><b>B) COVID-19 Tests during SHN</b></i>

**ALL** travellers will be scheduled to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (“PCR test”) on Day 10 of their arrival. Travellers who do not receive their test appointment details a day before the end of their SHN should seek for assistance in writing via [this form](https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry). 

Travellers serving SHN at an SDF must self-administer an ART on Days 3 and 7 of their arrival in Singapore [Click here](https://moh.gov.sg/covid-19/selftestart) for more information on ARTs.

Travellers are exempted from ART, if they have been approved to complete their SHN in their residence or accommodation of choice. Travellers are exempted from ART, if they:
- Are a fully vaccinated traveller with a 21-day travel history to any Category (I) to (III) country/region; **AND**
- Been approved to complete their SHN in their residence or accommodation of choice.

<!--**From 22 October 2021**, in addition to self-administering an ART on Days 3 and 7, travellers will be required to self-administer an ART on Day 10 of their arrival in Singapore, in place of taking a PCR test. Self-administered ART is required regardless of SHN location.-->

Travellers who are serving SHN at their own place of residence may use private transport to commute from their SHN accommodation for the COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test that is administered on the last day of SHN. The costs for transport are as per the table at Stage 3D.

### Stage 5: End of Stay-Home Notice

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Release from Stay-Home Notice(SHN)</b></i>

Travellers can leave their SHN accommodation only **after** the end-of SHN COVID-19 test result is negative. The result of the test will be communicated to you via a call, email, or SMS about 24 hours from when the test was administered.. Travellers with Singpass may also view their results via the  [HealthHub App](https://www.healthhub.sg/HealtheServices). 

For travellers serving SHN at an SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF), the checkout timing will be conveyed to the traveller by the SDF and they can only leave after the SDF staff have informed them to do so. 

Travellers who test positive for [COVID-19](/health/covid19-symptoms) will and must receive [medical treatment](/health/covidtreatment). The prevailing treatment charges will apply.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) Advisory on prevailing COVID-19 management in Singapore</b></i>

After SHN, travellers may go about their activities but **must** comply with the latest public health measures. This includes the use of the [TraceTogether app](https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/), which allows the identification of close contacts of a positive COVID-19 case. For the latest measures visit the Ministry of Health [website](https://moh.gov.sg/covid-19-phase-advisory) for more details.

Some activities in Singapore may require proof of vaccination (e.g. attendance at large scale events, dining restrictions). If you had been vaccinated overseas, click [here](/health/vtsg) for details on whether you qualify, and how to receive local recognition of your vaccinated status.
