The use of public transport (e.g. trains, buses, street-hailed taxis) is prohibited. Travellers must rely on the same transport options when commuting from their SHN accommodation for the COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test that is administered on the last day of SHN. To guarantee a smooth journey, click [here](/health/faq#transport) for the relevant transport advisories.

### Stage 4: Stay-Home Notice and COVID-19 Tests

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Serve Stay-Home Notice (SHN)</b></i>

A Stay-Home Notice (SHN) comes into effect immediately upon its issuance. Travellers **must** remain in the SHN accommodation for the period specified in their SHN, **unless** they have/have been:
- Directed by the relevant authorities to do so;
- Scheduled to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR test”) at the end of the SHN period; or
- Received a negative PCR test result for the test taken on the last day of SHN.

To calculate the estimated SHN end-date, click [here](/shn-calculator) for an SHN calculator. Travellers may complete their SHN at their own residence, self-sourced hotel, or serviced apartment. Travellers planning to serve their SHN at a self-sourced hotel should only secure their bookings after checking and ensuring that the hotel of choice can accommodate guests on SHN. Travellers may refer to [this page](https://sha.org.sg/hotel-accommodation) for the non-exhaustive list of hotels offering SHN-accommodation.

During the SHN period, randomised in-person or phone/video compliance check(s) will be conducted. Failure to comply with any SHN-related requirement is an offence under the Infectious Diseases Act. Errant travellers can expect to be fined, imprisoned, and/or have their residency/work permits revoked. For more information on SHN-related compliance matters, click [here](/health/shn#shn-compliance-checks).

&#9744;  <i><b>B) COVID-19 Tests during SHN</b></i>

<!--**For arrivals before 22 Oct 2021**,--> 
Travellers will be scheduled to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (“PCR test”) on the last day of the SHN. Travellers who do not receive their test appointment details a day before the end of their SHN should seek for assistance in writing via [this form](https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry). 

<!--**For arrivals from 22 Oct 2021**, Travellers will require to self-administer an Antigen Rapid Test(ART) on D7 of their SHN, in place of taking a PCR test.-->

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Release from Stay-Home Notice(SHN)</b></i>

Travellers can leave their SHN accommodation only **after** the end-of SHN COVID-19 test result is negative. The result of the test will be communicated to you via a call, email, or SMS about 24 hours from when the test was administered.
