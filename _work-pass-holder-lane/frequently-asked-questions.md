### General Queries

#### 1. I had applied for an Entry Approval under the Work Pass Holder General Lane but was not informed of the application outcome. What should I do?

Applicants should note that all applications will only be processed after payment is made. Depending on your email settings, the approval letter may be found in your spam or junk folder. Should you have difficulties locating the approval letter please write in with details of your application (e.g. application reference number, FIN and FIN expiry of your employee) to the following channels: 
- If you applied via the SafeTravel Portal, write in using the SafeTravel enquiries form ([here](https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry)) for assistance.
- If you applied directly with MOM, please write to MOM [here](https://service2.mom.gov.sg/efeedback/Forms/efeedback.aspx) for assistance.

#### 2. My employee plans to leave Singapore for a short personal trip. How should I advise them?

Employers may highlight to their employees that the travel restrictions implemented worldwide to curb the spread of [COVID-19](/health/covid19-symptoms) could affect flight availability and their ability to return to Singapore for work promptly. They will also be subject to the prevailing health measures on return. Additionally, the Singapore Government no longer covers the relevant medical costs for all new and existing pass holders who develop COVID-19 symptoms or test positive within 14 days of arrival in Singapore (press release [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/updates-to-stay-home-notice-and-charging-policy-for-travellers)).

#### 3. My employee has been approved for entry into Singapore under the Work Pass Holder General Lane (WPHL). However, he/she is unable to enter Singapore on the date specified in the application, or I no longer wish to bring them in. What should I do? 

To bring your employee into Singapore on another date, please submit a new entry application for him/her to enter Singapore on another date. 

For us to consider a refund of the entry charges for the previous application, please submit a request to cancel the entry approval:

In general, all pre-payments made for the cost of the Stay-Home Notice Dedicated Facility (SDF) stay and COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”) are non-refundable. This is to cover the relevant cost incurred for securing and preparing the SDF for the traveller. A refund can be considered subject to MOM’s assessment.

#### 4. My employee has recently recovered from COVID-19. Can I bring them into Singapore immediately?

Please refer to the FAQ on recovered travellers [here](/health/faq#recovered).

#### 5. I am an employer of a helper/confinement nanny who is due to enter Singapore. However, I need help to submit an entry application or to fulfil the travel health control measures (e.g. arranging for my helper's or nanny’s SHN accommodation and her pre-departure COVID-19 test) What should I do?

You may wish to engage an employment agency to submit an application on your behalf. In this case, the employment agency will need to ensure that the travel health control measures are fulfilled.

#### 6. I cannot submit an entry application as my employee does not have a Singapore-registered mobile phone number. As I urgently require manpower, can I submit my own mobile phone number instead?

No, employers/applicants are required to submit their Singapore-registered mobile phone number used by an arriving employee. The contact number provided in the entry approval application would be used by the relevant authorities to conduct Stay-Home Notice (SHN) compliance checks. Employers should note that the Singapore government takes a strict view on SHN non-compliance, and will not hesitate to take immediate action aganist errant travellers. Depending on the facts of the case, this may include a fine/imprisonment term under the Infectious Diseases Act, and the revocation of workpasses. Employers should therefore ensure that their employees are contactable at all times when serving their SHN.

If an employee does not own an active Singapore-registered mobile phone number, the employer (i.e. companies or employment agencies) may enquire with the relevant telcos on the purchase of company-registered prepaid SIM cards. Employers who have submitted the company-registered number on behalf of their employees in the Entry Approval Application, are responsible to:
- Enlist the help of the SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF) operator to ensure that the correct prepaid SIM card is delivered to their employee(s), i.e. employee should receive the correct prepaid SIM card with the assigned mobile number to fulfil the entry approval application; and
- Ensure that their employee upon receiving the prepaid SIM card, promptly register* the SIM card using his/her identification document(passport).

Employment agencies that hire foreign domestic workers/confinement nannies (the "Employee") may also purchase company-registered prepaid SIM cards on behalf of the Employee. The employment agencies are responsible to ensure that the Employee upon receiving the SIM card, promptly register* the SIM card using his/her identification document(passport).

[<span>*</span><i>Note: Unregistered prepaid SIM cards cannot be used to facilitate calls.</i>]

### MOM-issued Passes: Applications, Extensions and Levies

#### 1. The Visit Pass issued to my Confinement Nanny is expiring before the end of her work assignment. Do I need to extend her Visit Pass?

You need to request for an extension of her stay if:
- The duration of her visit pass does not cover her employment period. If she is transferring to another employer in Singapore, you can make the request for her, or she can engage an employment agency to do so. 
- She leaves Singapore during the employment period. Her visit pass will be cancelled when she leaves, and you have to request for an extension each time she leaves and returns to Singapore.

Please [submit the extension request](https://form.gov.sg/5d01bad00816b400111ce556) at least 2 weeks before her visit pass expires and upload these documents:
-  Front and back of her Disembarkation/Embarkation (D/E) card (maximum 1MB) 
- Personal particulars page of her passport (maximum 1MB)

We will email you the outcome within 2 weeks. A $40 extension fee will be charged for each extension made beyond 3 months from the date the visit pass was issued. 

#### 2. My employee’s work pass is expiring. He/She is unable to return to Singapore for the pass renewal due to the travel restrictions imposed in their home country or are unable to obtain an entry approval. What should I do? 

We advise employers to submit a new work pass application for such employees after the situation stabilises. 

#### 3. Can employers get a levy waiver for their helpers, Work Permit or S Pass holder who are required to serve SHN upon their arrival to Singapore? 

MOM will waive the levies for all helpers, Work Permit and S Pass holders for the duration of their SHN from January till September 2021. This is to help employers manage the increased costs associated with the Government’s updated measures to reduce the risk of importing COVID-19 into the community. Please refer to MOM’s [press release](https://mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/2021/0401-waiver-of-fwl-for-migrant-workers-and-migrant-domestic-workers-during-their-shn) for more information. 
 
#### 4. Can employers get a levy waiver for helpers, Work Permit or S Pass holders who have returned home or gone on overseas leave?

For employees on home or overseas leave, employers can [apply for levy waiver](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/Employer/MyRequestEmployer) (for up to 60 days) **when the employees return to Singapore**.

#### 5. Must I still pay my helper salary while she is serving her Stay-Home Notice (SHN)?

For new helpers, you must start paying them salary once they are deployed to your house after SHN.

For existing helpers returning from overseas, you must continue paying them salary once they return to Singapore.

### Covid-19 Tests

#### 1. My employee has recently recovered from COVID-19. Are they still required to be tested for COVID-19 before entry into Singapore?

Please refer to the FAQ for recovered travellers [here](/health/faq#pcrtestQ5).

#### 2. My employee is required to take a COVID-19 test in Singapore as part of the entry requirements. How do I arrange for the test and do I need to pay?

You would be required to pay for the COVID-19 test and other entry charges during the entry application. Employers do not need to arrange for the COVID-19 test administered during their SHN for their employees. These appointments are scheduled automatically, and pass holders would receive the appointment details as an SMS. 

For the on-arrival COVID-19 test, employers will need to book and pay for them. 

#### 3. Is my employee required to take a Serology test in Singapore? How so I arrange for the test and am I also required to pay for this?

The following groups of workers with travel history to <a href="https://go.gov.sg/responsibilities-submitters-pass-holders">Category III or IV countries/regions</a> in the last 14 days (excluding transits) before their arrival, are required to take a Serology test in Singapore.

- Confinement nannies
- Helpers
- Work Permit and S Pass holders from the Construction, Marine shipyard and Process (CMP) sectors

Employers do not need to arrange for the serology test appointment as this would be scheduled automatically by the relevant Government agency. There is no need for the employee to pay for the serology test upon arrival as the cost of the test would have been included when payment was made by their employer during entry application. Employers can check the details of the Serology test for their employee through: 
- [Safe@Work Portal](https://mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/safe-work) for Work Permit and S Pass holders from the CMP sectors
- [Email MOM](mailto:ace_mom@mom.gov.sg) for confinement nannies and helpers 

#### 4. My employee claims to be unwell while serving their Stay-Home Notice (SHN). What should I do?

Travellers who are [ill or unwell](/health/covid19-symptoms) while serving their SHN should alert MOM using the [FWMOMCare app](https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/fwmomcare) and remain in their accommodation. In the event of a medical emergency, please advise your employee to alert the SHN-Dedicated Facility (SDF) operator and call 995 for assistance.

##### For information on the Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) requirement imposed on workers that are in Singapore, click [here](https://mom.gov.sg/covid-19/frequently-asked-questions/rostered-routine-testing). 

<a href="#top">Click here to return to the top.</a>

<div id="shn"></div>

### Stay-Home Notice (SHN) and SHN-Dedicated Facilities

#### 1. Can my employee leave their Stay-Home Notice (SHN) accommodation for any pass issuance-related procedures, e.g. medical examination, finger printing, Settling-in Programmes or safety courses?

As a condition for entry under the Work Pass Holder General Lane (WPHL), travellers who have been served an [SHN](/health/shn) upon arrival in Singapore must complete their SHN before proceeding with their regular activities. This means that your employee must not do any of the pass issuance-related procedures until they have completed their SHN and tested negative for COVID-19.

Travellers and employers should note that non-compliance with the SHN conditions is an offence that could attract a fine and/or imprisonment term. MOM may also initiate pass revocation procedures or withdraw the relevant work pass privileges. 

In general, individual served with an SHN are not permitted to leave their SHN accommodation, including the [SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF)](/health/shn/sdf), during the stipulated SHN period. Travellers are only permitted to leave their SHN accommodation or SDF for their [COVID-19  tests](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest). Transport to and from the designated testing facility would be arranged as travellers are prohibited from commuting using public transport.

#### 2. Is my helper/confinement nanny allowed to share rooms at the Stay-Home Notice Dedicated Facility (SDF)? Where can I submit the room sharing application?

Employers may request for a shared room on behalf of their employees during the entry application. However, employers should advise their employees on the health risks involved in a room sharing arrangement, which could result in increased risk of infection and attract additional charges, e.g. medical treatment.

Should your employee acknowledge the health risks but continue to express interest on sharing rooms, employers should provide their employees with an indemnity form for completion and signing. These forms are available below, and employers are encouraged to provide their employees with a form in a language familiar to them.

Employers should remind their employees to present the following documents to the SDF operator during check-in, who will then facilitate the room sharing arrangement:
- Entry approval letter
- Completed and signed indemnity form (your employee may ask for a blank indemnity form from the SDF if they forget to print a copy).

### COVID-19 Vaccination Requirements for Work Pass Holders and Dependants

#### 1. Who will the vaccination entry requirement apply to?

From 10 August 2021, work pass holders and their dependants (aged 18 and above) with travel history to [Category III or IV countries/regions](/wphl/shn-and-swab-summary) and are fully vaccinated 14 days before they arrive in Singapore can apply for entry approval. 

<b>Note:</b> From 1 Nov 2021, all pass holders and their dependants from Category I or II countries/region, as well as CMP workers, helpers and confinement nannies from all countries/regions must be fully vaccinated 14 days before they  arrive in Singapore.


#### 2. What are the COVID-19 vaccines that meet the vaccination entry requirement?

Eligible work pass holders and their dependants must complete the full course of vaccination with vaccines approved under the [Health Sciences Authority’s Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR)](https://www.hsa.gov.sg/hsa-psar) or the [World Health Organization’s Emergency Use Listing (WHO-EUL)](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/covid-19-vaccines) at least 14 days before they arrive in Singapore. 

Work pass holders will need to show proof of vaccination. If the vaccination certificate is not in English, it should be translated to English and notarised. 

#### 3. My Construction/Marine Shipyard/Process (CMP) Work Permit/S Pass holder has been fully vaccinated. When can I submit an entry application to bring him into Singapore?

From 15 Oct 2021, we will be accepting entry approval applications for fully vaccinated S Pass and Work Permit holders from CMP sectors entering Singapore from [Category III or IV countries/regions](/wphl/shn-and-swab-summary) . Entry approval slots will be limited, and pass holders may have to wait about three to six months before they can enter Singapore. 

#### 4. I am medically ineligible for vaccination. How can I appeal to be exempted from the vaccination condition for entry?  
You may appeal for an [exemption from the vaccination condition for entry](https://form.gov.sg/#!/610b4fe79eba440012bddce5), supported by a doctor’s memo. You will need to obtain the exemption before applying for entry approval. 

#### 5. My pass holder gets exempted from serving SHN at dedicated facilities when he enters Singapore via the Vaccinated Traveller Lane (VTL). Why is he not given the same exemption if he is entering Singapore using the Work Pass Holder General Lane (WPHL) for work pass holders?

Work pass holders entering via the WPHL must meet vaccination requirements as part of conditions for entry. As this is applied to pass holders entering Singapore from many countries/regions of higher importation risk, the pass holders will continue to be subjected to the full SHN requirements upon entry, for public health reasons. Work pass holders who qualify for a stepped-down SHN regime under the VTL may cancel their MOM entry approval and submit another application to enter under the VTL. 

Companies can cancel entry approvals for pass holders using this [online form](http://www.mom.gov.sg/cancel-entry-approval):

Work Holiday Pass, or PEP (without employers) and EntrePass holders without a Corppass can cancel entry approvals for themselves and their dependants using this [online form](http://www.mom.gov.sg/cancel-entry-individual).

#### 6. My helper/confinement nanny is fully vaccinated. When can I submit an entry application to bring her into Singapore?

From 15 Oct 2021, we will be accepting entry approval applications for fully vaccinated helpers/confinement nannies entering Singapore from [Category III or IV countries/regions](/wphl/shn-and-swab-summary) . Entry approval slots will be limited, and helpers/nannies may have to wait about three to six months before they can enter Singapore. 

#### 7. My pass holder is fully vaccinated, but not with a vaccine on the PSAR or WHO EUL list. Can I submit an entry application for him/her?

Pass holders who are vaccinated with the full regimen of [Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR)-approved](https://www.hsa.gov.sg/hsa-psar) or [WHO EUL vaccines](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/covid-19-vaccines) (refer to **“COVID-19 Vaccine EUL issued”** section) will be prioritised for entry. Vaccines requiring 2 doses can be completed either using the [same or different brands](/health/vtsg) and taken based on the recommended intervals between each dose.

Pass holders who took other types of vaccines will not meet the entry requirements. Thus, please **do not** submit entry applications for them.

#### 8. My pass holder is unvaccinated but has recovered from a previous COVID-19 infection. Does he/she still need to be fully vaccinated before arriving in Singapore?

Yes, all pass holders with travel history to <a href="https://go.gov.sg/responsibilities-submitters-pass-holders">Category III or IV countries/regions</a> in the last 14 days before arriving in Singapore must be [fully vaccinated](/wphl/vaccination-requirements) before arrival. 

#### 9. My pass holder is fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and tested negative for COVID-19 in the pre-departure PCR test. Can he/she be exempted from Stay-Home Notice (SHN)?

Fully vaccinated pass holders are still subject to the [prevailing travel health control measures](https://go.gov.sg/responsibilities-submitters-pass-holders), which include serving SHN depending on their travel histories. 

#### 10. My pass holder has a doctor’s memo stating he/she cannot be vaccinated due to medical conditions. Can he/she show this memo at the checkpoint, without having to request for an exemption?

No, pass holders need to obtain an approval from Ministry of Manpower (MOM) to be exempted. Companies must submit an [exemption request for their pass holders](https://www.mom.gov.sg/exempt-vaccination) and upload the doctor’s memo. If the request is approved, your company can then proceed with the [pass holder’s entry application](https://go.gov.sg/wphl-requirements).

#### 11. My pass holder does not wish to send his/her child (aged 12 years old to below 18 years old) for the COVID-19 vaccination in Singapore. Can the child be exempted?

Unvaccinated children who are 12 years old to below 18 years old on date of entry must get their first vaccination in Singapore using a [PSAR-approved vaccine](https://www.hsa.gov.sg/hsa-psar) within 1 month of arrival. They must complete the full vaccination regime within 2 months of arrival.

However, if the child cannot be vaccinated due to medical conditions, please get a doctor’s memo which must meet all these requirements:
- States child’s medical condition 
- States reason why the child cannot take any COVID-19 vaccinations, regardless of the brand of vaccine 
- Is clear and not handwritten
- (Only applicable if memo is not in English) Is accompanied with an English-translated copy from a translation service provider

Please produce the memo when requested by the authorities. 

#### 12. My pass holder was vaccinated 2 days ago. Can he/she enter Singapore next week?

No, the pass holder cannot enter Singapore yet. 

Pass holders must receive the full regimen of [WHO EUL vaccines](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/covid-19-vaccines) (refer to **“COVID-19 Vaccine EUL issued”** section) **at least 14 days before arriving in Singapore**.  Vaccines requiring 2 doses can be completed either using the [same or different brand](/health/vtsg) and taken based on recommended intervals between each dose. 

Example: If the pass holder received the full vaccine regimen on 1 Sep, the earliest he/she can enter Singapore is **15 Sep**.

#### 13. My pass holder is fully vaccinated and took a serology test at a Public Health Preparedness Clinic. However, the serology test result was negative or inconclusive. What happens next?

The pass holder will have to take 2 doses of a [PSAR-approved vaccine](https://www.hsa.gov.sg/hsa-psar) in Singapore within 2 months of the negative serology test result. Failure to do so may result in the suspension and revocation of the pass holder’s work pass privileges.
