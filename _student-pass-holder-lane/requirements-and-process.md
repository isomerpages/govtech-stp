<b><span style="color:red">[NOTICE]</span></b>
<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.5; color:red;"><b>New entry approvals have been reduced or halted until further notice for all long term pass holders with travel history to higher-risk countries/regions (i.e. all countries/regions, except Australia, Brunei, Hong Kong, Macao, Mainland China and New Zealand). If you are unable to find an entry date in the SafeTravel application portal, please defer your travel plans until the situation has stabilised.

### Overview

The Student’s Pass Holder Lane (STPHL) is a Safe Travel Lane that Student’s Pass (STP) holders and eligible accompanying family members may use to enter Singapore. All STP holders and eligible accompanying family members must obtain entry approval before travelling to Singapore.

### 1. Eligibility 

The following travellers are eligible to apply for entry through the Student’s Pass Holder Lane:
- Student’s Pass (STP) holder, including Student’s Pass – In Principle Approval (STP-IPA) holder, in Ministry of Education (MOE) schools, Institutes of Higher Learning, Arts Institutions, Private Education Institutions (PEIs), and other schools/institutions (e.g. preschools);
- Accompanying parent/guardian of STP holders who are 19 years old and under (only one accompanying adult per family unit is allowed);
- Accompanying siblings, not enrolled in an educational institution, who are 6 years old and under;
- Accompanying spouse and children of STP holders on post-graduate programmes.

*For accompanying family members, please note that:*
- *Accompanying family members must send their application and travel together with the STP holders to be eligible for entry application through the STPHL. Different travel dates between STP holders and their family members will not be allowed.*
- *Accompanying family members must hold an ICA-issued pass (e.g. Long-Term Visit Pass) or be a short-term visitor to be eligible for entry application through the STPHL. Short-term visitors who are eligible for entry into Singapore will receive a Short-Term Visit Pass on arrival. For more information on the prevailing entry requirements, you may visit the main ICA website [here](https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-depart/entry_requirements)*. 

The following groups should **not** apply for entry through the STPHL: 
- Foreign students and their family members holding MOM-issued passes (e.g. Dependent’s Pass) are not eligible for entry application through the STPHL. They should refer to the application process for the [Work Pass Holder General Lane (WPHL)](/wphl/overview).
- Immediate family members or relatives of Singapore Citizens (SC) or Singapore Permanent Residents (PR) should **not** apply for entry through the STPHL. They should apply via the [Familial Ties Lane](/scpr-familial-ties-lane/requirements-and-process) instead. 

### 2. Check Border Health Requirements

Please familiarise yourself with the indicative border health requirements including Stay Home Notice (SHN) duration and swab requirements depending on your travel history in the past 21 days prior to arriving in Singapore, via this table [here](/files/SHN-and-swab-summary.pdf). You may click the links to find out more about [SHN](/health/shn), [SHN in dedicated facilities](/health/shn/sdf) and [COVID-19 swabs](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest), including details on costs and payment procedures.

The border health requirements may be subject to change, and the prevailing border health requirements will be applied to the traveller at the point of arrival.
