### General Queries

#### 1.	Who can I share the suite with?

Travellers can share the suite with the following family members who are serving SHN with the same travel history and duration: grandparents, parents, spouse, parents-in-law, siblings or children.

#### 2. Is there a maximum number of travellers that a suite can accommodate?

Different SDFs have different caps on the maximum number of persons that can be accommodated in a suite. Larger families may be asked to be accommodated in separate rooms, or interconnecting rooms (if available).

Travellers are strongly advised to verify with the SDF if the suite can accommodate the expected number of persons before confirming the booking.

#### 3.	Can I book a suite from an SDF that is not listed?  

No, only booking confirmations from the SDFs listed <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/shn/sdfupgrade#options">here</a> will be accepted.

#### 4.	Can I transfer to a suite if I am currently serving SHN in an SDF? 

Yes, travellers who are currently serving SHN in an SDF may book a suite with one of the SDFs listed <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/shn/sdfupgrade#options">here</a>. 

However, travellers should note that they will be charged additional costs of at least $345 ($300 for specialised cleaning costs of the vacated room; $45/vehicle for transport to the next SDF) for transfers requested mid-way through their SHN stay.

#### 5.	Can I transfer to a suite from any SDF?  

Yes, travellers can transfer from any SDF to a suite under the SDFs listed <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/shn/sdfupgrade#options">here</a>, regardless of which SDF they are currently serving SHN in. 

#### 6. I am interested in serving my SHN in a suite. How do I go about booking one?

To book a suite to complete your SHN in, please refer to the guide [here](/health/shn/sdfupgrade). 

#### 7. Do I need to inform anyone after I have booked my suite? What are the transport arrangements to bring me to the SDF where I had booked my suite?

Travellers must submit a form at <https://go.gov.sg/sdfsuite> to inform government agencies of the booking. This is to ensure you and your family members (if applicable) are conveyed to the SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF) where you had booked the suite.

For suite bookings before arrival in Singapore, the submission must be made at least 48 hours before your arrival in Singapore. Failure to do so may result in your assignment to a standard room at any SDF upon your arrival.

For suite bookings after arrival in Singapore, the submission must be made at least 48 hours prior to the intended stay at the suite. Please note that an additional fee of at least $345 ($300 for specialised cleaning costs for the vacated room and $45/vehicle for transport to the next SDF) applies.

#### 8. Can I make any changes to my suite booking?

To make changes to your suite bookings, please first contact the SDF to ensure that there is suite availability. Subsequently, please submit a form at <https://go.gov.sg/changesuitebooking> to inform government agencies of your updated details.

Please do not make multiple suite bookings. SDFs will be asked to cancel all bookings if a traveller is found to have made multiple bookings.


#### 9. The duration of SHN I am required to serve at an SDF changed after I booked my suite. Will I be able to stay in the suite I booked for the entire new duration of my SHN?

The SDF will contact you to share possible options and change in costs (if any). If your SHN duration was increased, your suite booking is subject to availability. If the same suite is available, the [latest costs](/health/shn/sdfupgrade#options) will apply for the additional days (after pro-ration). If your SHN duration was reduced, the cost will be pro-rated based on the actual number of days stayed in the suite.

### Payment and Cost Issues

#### 1.	How much will I be charged if I am already serving my SHN in a SHN dedicated facility (SDF)? 

Travellers will be charged a pro-rated cost for the suite, based on the number of nights spent at the suite, if they book a suite mid-way through their SHN stay.

In addition, travellers will also be charged additional costs of at least $345 ($300 for specialised cleaning costs for the vacated room; $45/vehicle for transport to the next SDF) for their transfers.

For example, total costs for a traveller on 7-day SHN at an SDF: [2/7 * $1,015 at existing SDF] + [5/7 * $3,745 at the standard suite] + $345 = $3,310. Travellers who have already paid the default SDF cost only need to pay the difference.

#### 2. How do I pay for my suite?

Travellers who have booked a suite prior to arrival should make payment for the suite directly to the SDF upon check-in. Travellers who fail to make payment will be assigned to any standard SDF room.

Travellers who are transferring to another suite mid-way through their SHN stay should make payment for the suite at their existing SDF when checking-out.

#### 3. I have already paid for my SDF stay when I applied for my entry approval/SafeTravel Pass. Will I be charged again by the SDF when I check into my SDF suite?

Travellers who have made pre-payment when obtaining approval to enter Singapore will be required to pay the difference from the higher cost of the SDF suite. This additional amount will be paid to the SDF at check-in.

For example: If traveller has already paid $1,015 to an agency when obtaining approval to enter Singapore, and later decides to book a ‘Standard’ suite at Fairmont Singapore before arrival, the traveller will need to pay the balance of $1,950 to Fairmont Singapore at check-in (assuming a 7-day SDF stay and excluding $345 for cleaning and transportation costs).
