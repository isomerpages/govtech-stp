# Book an SDF Suite at Higher Cost

Subject to availability, travellers who are required to complete their [Stay-Home Notice (SHN)](/health/shn) at an [SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF)](/health/shn#sdf) may book a suite at higher cost. Travellers can refer to the guide below. Travellers are responsible for checking their eligibility before booking a suite.

[Click here](/health/shn/sdfsuitefaq) for the FAQs on booking an SDF suite.

## For Suite Bookings Before Arrival

**Step 1:** Non-fully vaccinated travellers who require entry approval to Singapore should obtain their entry approval before making a suite booking. For more information on the entry requirements for non-fully vaccinated travellers, please click [here](/arriving/general-travel/non-fully-vaccinated).

**Step 2:** Travellers should contact the SDFs listed under the [Suite Options](#options) section below to directly enquire and book their preferred suite, if available. Travellers should check their eligibility based on their travel history before booking their suite.

**Step 3:** After booking a suite with their preferred SDF, travellers should immediately inform government agencies of the booking at [https://go.gov.sg/sdfsuite](https://go.gov.sg/sdfsuite). This is to ensure that conveyance to the right SDF (where the suite was booked) is arranged. <u>The submission must be made at least 48 hours before the traveller’s arrival in Singapore. Travellers who fail to submit their booking details on time may be assigned to a standard room at any SDF upon arrival.</u> The charge for a subsequent transfer to another SDF is at least S$345 (S$300 for specialised cleaning costs for the vacated room; S$45/vehicle for transport to the next SDF).
 
**Step 4:** Travellers (including Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents) will pay for the full cost of the suite directly to the SDF during check-in. Travellers who have already paid the default SDF cost when applying for entry approval or a SafeTravel Pass will pay the difference in cost directly to the SDF during check-in.

## For Suite Bookings After Arrival

**Step 1:** Travellers should note that for suite bookings made after arrival in Singapore, you will need to pay an additional fee of at least S$345 (S$300 for specialised cleaning costs for the vacated room; S$45/vehicle for transport to the next SDF). 

**Step 2:** Travellers should contact the SDFs listed under [Suite Options](#options) section above to directly enquire and book their preferred suite, if available.

**Step 3:**  After booking a suite with their preferred SDF, travellers must submit their booking details and confirmation at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sdfsuite" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/sdfsuite</a>. This is to ensure that conveyance to the right SDF (where the suite was booked) is arranged. <u>The submission must be made at least 48 hours prior to the intended stay at the suite.</u>

**Step 4:** Your existing SDF will contact you about the transport arrangements to the selected SDF and will collect payment for the additional costs at check-out. The cost of the suite will be pro-rated according to the number of remaining SHN days left to serve.
