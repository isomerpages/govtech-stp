### IMPORTANT NOTICE: SUSPENSION OF AIR TRAVEL PASS FOR VIETNAM 

Given the evolving COVID-19 situation in Vietnam, Singapore will tighten border measures for travellers with travel history to Vietnam within the last 14 days before departure for Singapore. 


### Short-term Visitors 

**Short-term visitors with travel history to Vietnam, within the last 14 days before departure for Singapore**, will not be allowed to enter Singapore with effect from **12 February 2021, 2359hrs (Singapore time)**. Please refer to the press release [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/updates-on-border-measures-for-travellers-from-vietnam-new-south-wales-(australia)-and-business-travel-pass-scheme) issued by the Singapore Ministry of Health (MOH) dated 9 February 2021. 

For avoidance of doubt, these revised measures do not apply to Air Travel Pass (ATP) holders who are entering Singapore **before 12 February 2021, 2359hrs**. 

With immediate effect, applications for the ATP for short-term visitors travelling from Vietnam will be suspended until further notice. 

### Singapore Citizens/Permanent Residents/Long-Term Pass Holders 

Singapore Citizens (SC), Permanent Residents (PR), and Long-Term Pass holders can still travel from Vietnam to Singapore via the [Returning SC/PRs lane](/sc-pr/requirements-and-process), [Work Pass Holder General Lane](/wphl/requirements-and-process) or [Student’s Pass Holder Lane](/stpl/requirements-and-process). Short term visitors with SC/PR family in Singapore and who need to enter Singapore for extenuating reasons can do so via the [SC/PR Familial Ties Lane](/scpr-familial-ties-lane/requirements-and-process).
