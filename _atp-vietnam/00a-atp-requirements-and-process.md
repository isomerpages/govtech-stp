### 1. Eligibility 

<span class="font-size:16px;">Foreigners who are short-term visitors travelling from Vietnam may seek entry into Singapore by applying for an Air Travel Pass (ATP).</span>
            
<span class="font-size:16px;">Singapore Citizens, Singapore Permanent Residents, and Singapore Long-Term Pass holders are not required to apply for an ATP to travel to Singapore. However, Singapore Long-Term Pass holders will still have to seek entry approval from the relevant Singapore Government agencies, which issued their Long-Term Pass, before travelling to Singapore. Please refer <a href="/health/shn">here</a> for the prevailing health measures applicable upon entry into Singapore.</span>

    <td style="font-size:16px;">Foreigners, who are short-term visitors, may apply for an ATP for entry into Singapore at no charge <a href="https://go.gov.sg/atpsg">here</a>. Applications must be made between 7 and 30 calendar days prior to the visitor’s intended date of entry into Singapore. When an ATP application is approved, an approval letter will be sent to the applicant via email.

     <br/><br/>
Visitors must comply with the <a href="/vietnam/atp/conditions"> Conditions</a> of the Air Travel Pass, and the prevailing immigration requirements of the Singapore Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) for their entry and stay in Singapore. Visitors who do not meet the Air Travel Pass conditions may be refused entry into Singapore and/or have their Air Travel Pass cancelled. In such an event, visitors may also be liable for the cost of their repatriation, including custody and maintenance pending repatriation. In addition, their future Air Travel Pass applications may also be rejected. <br/><br/>
Personal data will be collected for Air Travel Pass applications. Please click <a href="/privacy">here</a> to view the Privacy Statement.<br/><br/>

<span style="color:red;"> <b>IMPORTANT</b><br/>
Given the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the relevant authorities in Singapore may, at their own discretion, introduce new measures or requirements to safeguard public health. This may include changes to the conditions or cancellation of the Air Travel Pass at short notice. Visitors will be notified of changes to the conditions or cancellation of their Air Travel Passes.
