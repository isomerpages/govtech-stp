The Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) is a Safe Travel Lane agreed between the Governments of Singapore and Malaysia. It supports companies in Singapore and Malaysia by facilitating the movement of workers between both countries. Companies that need to bring their employees into Malaysia or Singapore can sponsor an application.

Under the PCA, approved travellers/employees are required to remain in their country of employment for at least 90 days before returning to their home country for short-term home leave. Cross-border entry under the PCA is only permitted via land at the Causeway and Second link. 

Upon arrival in Singapore, all PCA-approved travellers/employees will serve a 10-day <a href="/health/shn">Stay-Home Notice</a> (SHN), where they will undergo a <a href="/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest">COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)</a> test on Day 10, before they exit their SHN.
