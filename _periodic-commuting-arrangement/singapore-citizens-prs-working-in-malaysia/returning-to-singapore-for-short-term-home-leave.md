From 7 May 2021, 2359 hrs, all travellers with travel history to Malaysia in the last 21 days before arriving in Singapore will be required to serve <u>a 21-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at dedicated SHN facilities (with no opt-out option)</u>.

For more information on the prevailing health measures for SC/PRs returning from abroad please refer [here](/health/shn).

Non-SC/PR travellers with travel history to Malaysia in the last 21 days before arriving in Singapore must take a <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest">COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test</a> ("PCR test") within 72 hours before departure. All inbound PCA travellers must be tested negative for COVID-19 by a recognised or accredited laboratory in Malaysia. As documentary proof that the traveller has taken the COVID-19 PCR test, travellers should ask for a copy of the COVID-19 PCR test report, that: 
- Is in English (or accompanied with an English translation);
- Contains the Traveller's name, and Date of Birth or Passport number (per the passport used to travel to Singapore); and
- Reflects the Date and result of the PCR test.
