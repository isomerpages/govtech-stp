### **A) General Queries**

<div id="Background"></div>

### **Background and Feedback**

#### 1. What is the Periodic Commuting Arrangement?

The Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) is a travel scheme negotiated between Singapore and Malaysia that requires travellers to stay in the destination country of work or business, i.e. Singapore or Malaysia, for a minimum 90-day period. Following the 90-day stay, sponsored travellers can return to their home country for short-term home leave via the Causeway or Second Link.

Entry into Singapore under the Singapore-issued PCA is open only to the following groups of travellers:

(i)	Malaysia Citizens and Malaysia Permanent Residents holding a valid Singapore-issued work pass; or
(ii)	Malaysia Citizens who are Singapore Permanent Residents.

#### 2. Is there a quota imposed on the number of travellers? Is there a way for me to check if there is available quota for the day of my employee’s planned travel to Singapore?

Yes, the quota serves as a public health safeguard that also ensures smooth checkpoint operations. Sponsors will be alerted during the application process if the quota for a specific day has been fully utilised.

#### 3. My PCA application has been submitted. How do I check my PCA application status?

You can check your PCA application status <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO/safeTravel/enquiry">here</a>.

#### 4. Who should I contact for feedback or queries?

You may call us at **6812 5555** or submit your query via the webform at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry">https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry</a>. We will endeavour to reply to you within 3-5 working days.

<div id="SDF"></div>

### **Stay-Home Notice**

#### 1. My place of residence is unsuitable for me to serve my Stay-Home Notice (SHN). Can I opt to serve my SHN at the SHN-Dedicated Facility (SDF) instead?

Travellers are allowed to serve SHN at a self-sourced accommodation. This includes one’s place of residence or a suitable hotel. A place of residence is deemed suitable for SHN if travellers have a room to themselves, and a dedicated toilet. Please read the latest health advisory on the things to note when serving your SHN at www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19.

Travellers without a suitable place of residence for SHN may make a direct reservation with a suitable hotel from this <a href="https://sha.org.sg/stay-home-notice">list</a>. Before a room booking is made, travellers should check and ensure that the hotel can accommodate guests serving their SHN.

#### 2. When does the Stay-Home Notice (SHN) generally begin and how would I know if it has ended?

The SHN commences from the time the notice is issued to the traveller on arrival in Singapore and will be in effect until the traveller is notified of a negative result from the final COVID-19 test at the end of SHN. The duration of the SHN will be stated on your SHN document, and you can also <a href="/shn-calculator">click here</a> to calculate the end date of your SHN.

Travellers who are serving SHN at their own place of residence may end their SHN once they receive an SMS with their test result.

Travellers who are staying in SDF will be alerted by the SDF concierge on their check out time when they have received confirmation of the PCR test result.

<!--#### 3. What is a SHN Electronic Monitoring Device?

An <a href="/health/shn#device">Electronic Monitoring Device</a> (“device”) will be issued to travellers above 12 and are serving their Stay-Home Notice (SHN) outside an SHN-Dedicated Facility (SDF). It is used solely to detect travellers who have illegally left their SHN accommodation before the completion of SHN.

Your personal privacy is protected while using these devices. The device does not have any audio or video recording capabilities. All location data is transmitted via end-to-end encryption and can only be accessed by authorised government officials for investigation.-->

### **Transport Matters**

#### 1. I am serving Stay Home Notice or self-isolation at my own place of residence or self-sourced accommodation. What are the commuting/transport-related rules I should take note of in Singapore?

Please refer to the <a href="/faq#transport" target="_blank">latest transport advisory</a>.

<div id="Payment"></div>
 
### **Payment Matters**

#### 1. My employee is unable to enter Singapore on the date indicated in the application. Can I amend the application and seek a refund for the COVID-19 PCR test?

Employers are strongly encouraged to ensure that their employees can enter Singapore on the date indicated in the application. This is because the pre-payment made for the COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”) during application is <u>non-refundable</u>. Forfeited pre-payments will go towards covering the relevant cost incurred to secure and prepare an appointment for a traveller.

Requests for refunds or change in entry date will only be considered if there are unforeseen extenuating factors, e.g. compassionate reasons. For such cases, employers may write to <a href="mailto:COVID_SafeTravelAppeals@mti.gov.sg">COVID_SafeTravelAppeals@mti.gov.sg</a> with the relevant supporting documents.

#### 2. My employee was diagnosed with COVID-19 upon entry into Singapore. Who is responsible for his/her COVID-19 medical treatment?

The cost of the relevant COVID-19 medical treatment will be borne by the Singapore Government if the traveller was diagnosed with COVID-19 14 days <u>after</u> his/her entry into the country.

The cost arrangement for travellers diagnosed with COVID-19 within the first 14 days of his/her entry into Singapore is as follows:

</table>

#### 3. I am an approved PCA traveller holding the Malaysia-issued MyTravelPass. I am back in Singapore for my short-term home leave and was diagnosed with COVID-19. Who will pay for my medical treatment?

SCs/SPRs holding the Malaysia-issued MyTravelPass may access Government subsidies and MediShield Life / Integrated Shield Plan (MSHL/IP) to help pay for their bills.

### **B) For Employees/Sponsored Travellers**

<div id="SCPR"></div>

### **Eligibility (Singapore Citizens and Singapore Permanent Residents)**

#### 1. I am a Malaysian citizen and a Singapore Permanent Resident (PR) who is presently in Malaysia. Do I need to apply for a PCA pass to enter Singapore?

Singapore PR with a valid Entry/Re-Entry Permit may return to Singapore without the need for any entry approval. They will be subject to the prevailing health control measures for Singapore PRs, which includes:
- A COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test ("ART Test") or Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR Test”) taken within 2 days before departure<b> at a <a href="http://covid-19.moh.gov.my/garis-panduan/garis-panduan-kkm">recognised or accredited laboratories in Malaysia</a></b>;
- Serving 7-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at a declared SHN accommodation; and
- An exit PCR test

Singapore PRs whose employer in Singapore is willing to facilitate their home leave in Malaysia may return to Singapore under the PCA. 

#### 2. I am a Singapore-based Singapore Citizen/Singapore Permanent Resident holding a Malaysia Work Pass. Am I eligible for a PCA pass to return to Malaysia for business/work?

Yes, you are eligible to work in Malaysia under the PCA scheme. However, you are required to apply for entry approval, i.e. MyTravelPass, with the Malaysian authorities. You can reach out to the <a href="https://www.kln.gov.my/" target="_blank">Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a>, <a href="https://www.imi.gov.my/" target="_blank">Malaysian Immigration Department</a> or the <a href="https://www.kln.gov.my/web/sgp_singapore" target="_blank">Malaysian High Commission in Singapore</a> for advice.

#### 3. I am a Malaysian citizen and a Singapore PR. I am currently working in Singapore but I wish to return to Malaysia. Do I need to apply for a PCA pass to do so?

For further clarification on entry to Malaysia, you may wish to reach out to the <a href="https://www.kln.gov.my" target="_blank">Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a>, the <a href="https://www.imi.gov.my" target="_blank">Malaysian Immigration Department</a> or the <a href="https://www.kln.gov.my/web/sgp_singapore" target="_blank">Malaysian High Commission in Singapore</a> for further advice regarding entry to Malaysia.

<div id="PCRTraveller"></div>

### **COVID-19 Tests**

#### 1. What should I do if I feel unwell on or before the date of my end-of-SHN COVID-19 test appointment?

Travellers who are unwell should inform the relevant agencies immediately and should also not leave their accommodation for the COVID-19 test. Click [here](https://go.gov.sg/tc) for more details.

#### 2. Can I defer or change the appointment date/time of my end-of-SHN COVID-19 test?

No. All travellers must turn up for their COVID-19 test at the assigned date, time and site as this is crucial to mitigating the formation of crowds.

#### 3. What should I do if I have a medical condition, e.g. frequent nose bleeds, operations on face or nose area, tumours or cancers of the nose or throat area, that prevents me from providing a nasal swab sample for the COVID-19 test?

Travellers who are unable to take the test due to a medical condition should write in to [COVID_SafeTravelAppeals@mti.gov.sg](mailto:COVID_SafeTravelAppeals@mti.gov.sg) <b>at least</b> 7 working days before entry into Singapore. The employee or application sponsor should indicate in the email, the medical condition and provide the following details:
<ul>
<li>Name;</li>
<li>FIN No. (for work pass holder) or NRIC (for Singapore PR);</li>
<li>Date of Birth;</li>
<li>PCA approval letter; and</li>
<li>Employee and employer’s local contact number.</li>
</ul>
	
#### 4. I do not have my physical work pass. What should use as proof of my identity when I turn up for my end-of-SHN COVID-19 test?

Travellers can bring the [digital copy](https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/sgworkpass) of their Singapore-issued work pass and passport for identity verification.

Travellers who have misplaced their work pass should lodge a police report immediately. For identity verification purposes, this group of travellers should bring along their passport and police report (showing the FIN number).

#### 5. How much does it cost to take the end-of-SHN COVID-19 test? To whom and how should the payment be made?

The latest cost of the test is S$125. Payment would already be collected at the point of application.

### **C) For Employers/Application Sponsors**

<div id="GenIssues"></div>

### **General Issues**

#### 1. My employee has been approved for a PCA Pass but he is unable to travel to Singapore. Can I transfer his/her PCA approval to another employee?

No. An approval is given to a specific employee and it cannot be transferred; a separate application must be submitted for a new traveller.

#### 2. How long is my employee permitted to stay in Singapore under the PCA scheme? Am I required to extend the PCA period for my employee?
PCA approved travellers are permitted to remain in Singapore for as long as their long-term work pass or Singapore PR status is still valid.

Employers are only required to submit a fresh PCA application if an employee had left Singapore. Fresh PCA applications (for re-entry into Singapore), however, can only be submitted <u>90 days after</u> the employee’s entry into Singapore under the previous PCA approval.

#### 3. My employee is approved to travel to Singapore under the PCA scheme; however, he/she is only able to travel to Singapore by air. Can he/she still travel to Singapore? Or do I need to submit another application?

Travellers approved to visit Singapore under the PCA are only permitted to enter the country via the two land crossings, i.e. Second Link and Woodlands Causeway. Travellers entering Singapore from Malaysia via other means, e.g. air, should seek for an entry approval from [MOM](http://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-to-bring-pass-holders-into-singapore).

<div id="Eligibility"></div>

### **Eligibility**


#### 1. I run a domestic helper agency. Can I apply for a PCA for the domestic helpers on behalf of my clients?

No.

#### 2. I must send an employee to Malaysia for work/business purposes. Do I apply for a PCA pass using the SafeTravel application portal?

No. While the SafeTravel application portal is open to Singapore-based companies, it does not process entry applications for the Malaysian authorities.

Employers who plan on sending their employees to Malaysia for work/business purposes under the PCA scheme should check with the relevant Malaysian authorities, e.g. [Malaysian Immigration Department](https://www.imi.gov.my/portal2017/index.php/ms/sumber-dan-arkib/pengumuman/), for more information.

#### 4. Can my employee travel to Singapore under the PCA scheme for study, short-term work, or leisure purposes?

No. Employers can only sponsor a PCA application for employees that agree to remain in their country of employment, i.e. Singapore, for at least 90 days; <u>and</u> are:

i)	Holders of a valid MOM-issued long-term pass, e.g. employment pass, EntrePass, personalised employment pass, S pass, Work Permit, Training Employment Pass, Training work Permit and Work holiday pass; or 

ii)	Malaysian citizens who are a Singapore Permanent Residents employed in Singapore

Employees who fail to satisfy conditions (i) or (ii) above, e.g. Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP), Student’s Pass (STP), In-Principle Approval (IPA) for LTP holders, can consider seeking entry via other [SafeTravel lanes](/arriving/overview).

#### 5. My employee, who has been approved to enter Singapore under the PCA scheme, wishes to bring his/her family to Singapore. Can I sponsor a PCA application for the family member(s) of the said employee? They (family members) presently hold a Dependant’s Pass/Long-Term Visit Pass.

No. The PCA scheme facilitates travel <u>strictly</u> for a work or business purpose.

<div id="AppMatters"></div>

### **Application Matters**

#### 1. When should I submit a PCA application and what do I need to prepare for the application?

The steps and general timelines to go about submitting a PCA application are available [here](/pca/requirements-and-process).

Once an application is approved, an email will be sent to the contact person listed in the application. Application sponsors (i.e. the company) can also enquire about the status of the application [here](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO/safeTravel/enquiry).

#### 2. My employee has returned to Malaysia for home leave. Do I need to submit a new application to facilitate his/her return to Singapore?

If the employee had returned to Malaysia <u>with</u> a valid Singapore-issued PCA approval for a <b>future</b> entry date to return to Singapore, the employer <b>does not need to make a new application</b>. 

<b>If the employee had returned to Malaysia <u>without</u> a valid Singapore-issued PCA approval for a future entry date, the employer needs to make a fresh PCA application</b> on behalf of the employee.
 
#### 3. I am unable to submit a fresh PCA application for an employee who was previously approved under the scheme to travel to Singapore. Why is that so?
 
Fresh PCA applications can only be submitted for an entry date <u>90 days after</u> the employee’s previous entry into Singapore.

#### 4. Can I edit the details of my Employee/Sponsor details after my application has been approved?

Yes. From 1 March 2021, employers can update Sponsor's details and employee's passport details through the PCA application website via <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO/> at least 3 days before the approved date of entry. Employers will have to log in with their Corppass. Once the changes have been made, a new PCA confirmation letter will be sent to the Sponsor's email.
 
#### 5. What do I do if my employee needs to return to Malaysia before the 3-month (i.e. 90 days) stay is up?

The employee is permitted to leave Singapore. However, employers should note that they will only be able to apply for another PCA for the employee’s re-entry into Singapore, 90 days after their previous entry into Singapore.

### **End-of-SHN COVID-19 Test**

#### 1. Do I need to arrange for the end-of-SHN COVID-19 test for my employees? If not, how do I inform my employees of the date and time of their PCR test appointment?

Employers do not have to arrange for the COVID-19 test for their employees as these are automatically scheduled by the relevant authorities. Travellers will be scheduled for a PCR test before they exit their SHN.

While employers do not need to arrange for the tests, they are obligated to inform their employees of the details of their PCR test appointment, e.g. test date and time and location. These details will be sent to the employer as an SMS or email. In general, travellers will be required to take the PCR test toward the end of their [Stay Home Notice](/health/shn).

Employers or employees that do not have the details of the COVID-19 test appointment date, time and designated test site <u>by the 5th day </u> of the SHN period should write in using [SafeTravel Enquiry Form](https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry). Please include the employee’s name and FIN (for work pass holder) or NRIC (for Singapore PR), and employer’s mobile number for our follow up.

#### 2. My employee did not turn up for his/her end-of-SHN COVID-19 test on the scheduled date. Who can I contact to reschedule a new swab appointment?

All PCA travellers <b>must</b> adhere to their appointment timing for their COVID-19 test. Should an employee miss their first test appointment, a second test appointment will be scheduled; these details would be sent to the employer/employee. Employers should ensure that their employees turn up for their test appointment. Travellers who refuse to or continue to miss their COVID-19 PCR tests may be charged under the Infectious Diseases Act and have their work passes revoked.

Travellers should not turn up for their COVID-19 PCR test <u>if</u> they are unwell while serving their [Stay-Home Notice (SHN)](/health/shn). Such travellers should alert the relevant agencies immediately and remain in their accommodation. [Click here](https://go.gov.sg/tc) for the list of contact points on SHN and PCR test related issues. 

#### 3. How will I and/or my employee be informed of his/her COVID-19 test result?

COVID-19 test results will be sent to employers within 2 days of the test. Should there be a need for a second test, employers will be informed. Employers should remind their employees to remain in their accommodation until after being tested negative for COVID-19.

Employers that do not receive a notification of the test result, 2 days from when the test was taken, should either call us at 6812 5555 or submit a webform via <https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry>  and provide the employee’s name and FIN (for work pass holders) or NRIC number (for Singapore PRs), as well as the employer’s contact details.
