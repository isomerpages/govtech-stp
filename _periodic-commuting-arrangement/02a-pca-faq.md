**Notice for travellers with travel history to Malaysia:** *As there has been a recent increase in COVID-19 cases in Malaysia, **PCA travellers entering Singapore from 22 November 2020, 2359 hours**, who have a travel history in the past 14 days to Malaysia **will now be required** to serve <u>a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at dedicated SHN facilities.</u>* 

In addition, travellers who are not Singapore Citizens or Singapore Permanent Residents, and who have recent travel history to Malaysia within the last 14 days prior to entry will be required to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test within 72 hours before departure. Travellers will need to present a valid negative COVID-19 test result in English, from recognised or accredited laboratories in Malaysia, as a condition of approval to enter Singapore. This requirement will take effect for all inbound PCA travellers arriving in Singapore from **27 November 2020, 2359 hours**.

### **General**

#### 1. What is the Periodic Commuting Arrangement?

The Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) is a scheme agreed between Singapore and Malaysia to allow work and business-related travel between the two countries via the land border crossings at the Johor-Singapore Causeway and Malaysia-Singapore Second Link. Under the PCA, Malaysia Citizens and Malaysia Permanent Residents who are Singapore work pass holders are permitted to enter Singapore and should reside in Singapore for at least 90 days.

#### 2. What is the rationale for imposing a daily quota? Is there a webpage for me to check if the daily quota has been maximised?  Are there any plans to revise the daily quota in the future?

The quota is imposed to stagger and manage the volume of daily entrants via our land crossings. This mitigates the extent of crowds and congestion. It also allows swab operations to be conducted more smoothly, without overwhelming our public health system. While companies applying for the PCA are unable to check for the available quota, they will be alerted during registration if the quota has been maximised. Depending on the demand for PCA, the quota may be revised in future.

### **For Singapore Citizens/Permanent Residents**

#### 3. I am a Malaysian citizen and a Singapore PR. I am currently in Malaysia, but I want to return to Singapore. Do I need the PCA to return to Singapore?

### **SHN in SHN Dedicated Facilities – Employees with Travel History to Sabah in the past 14 days**

#### 51. What are dedicated SHN facilities?

To prevent potential spread of infection from PCA travellers who have a travel history to Sabah in the past 14 days, the Government has worked with hotel operators to provide dedicated facilities for the affected PCA travellers to serve their 14-day SHN. 
Transportation will be arranged to send the PCA travellers directly from the border checkpoint to the hotels. Each will have their own room/toilet, and will be provided all their meals, so that they may avoid physical contact with other individuals.

SHN dedicated hotels will be assigned to affected PCA travellers upon their arrival in Singapore. There will be no booking required.

#### 52. What are the costs for utilising the dedicated SHN facilities?

A 14-day SHN at the dedicated SHN facility will cost S$2000 (inclusive of GST). 

#### 53. Can I change the PCA entry date for employees who have a travel history in the past 14 days to Sabah, Malaysia?

No. We regret to inform you that no changes to the date of entry are allowed once an application has been approved. Please note that should your employee be unable to enter on the approved date, you will not be able to apply for another PCA for the same employee for a date of entry within 90 days from his/her last approved date of entry. 

#### 54. I have pre-booked a hotel/other accommodation to serve out my SHN prior to this announcement. Can I stay in my original hotel? Can I seek a refund? 

Affected PCA travellers are required to serve their SHN in the dedicated SHN facility, even if they have pre-booked other accommodation. Those who have arranged to serve out their SHN at other accommodation should inform their accommodation provider accordingly and discuss possible options for refund.
