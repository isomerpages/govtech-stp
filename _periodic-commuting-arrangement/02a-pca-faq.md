### **General**

#### 1. What is the Periodic Commuting Arrangement?

The Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) is a scheme agreed between Singapore and Malaysia to allow work and business-related travel between the two countries via the land border crossings at the Johor-Singapore Causeway and Malaysia-Singapore Second Link. Under the PCA, Malaysia Citizens and Malaysia Permanent Residents who are Singapore work pass holders or Malaysia Citizens who are Singapore Permanent Residents employed in Singapore are permitted to enter Singapore, and should reside in Singapore for at least 90 days.

#### 2. What is the rationale for imposing a daily quota? Is there a webpage for me to check if the daily quota has been maximised?  Are there any plans to revise the daily quota in the future?

The quota is imposed to stagger and manage the volume of daily entrants via our land crossings. This mitigates the extent of crowds and congestion. It also allows swab operations to be conducted more smoothly, without overwhelming our public health system. While companies applying for the PCA are unable to check for the available quota, they will be alerted during registration if the quota has been maximised. Depending on the demand for PCA, the quota may be revised in future.

### **For Singapore Citizens/Permanent Residents**

#### 3. I am a Malaysian citizen and a Singapore PR. I am currently in Malaysia, but I want to return to Singapore. Can I use the PCA to return to Singapore?

If you are a Singapore PR with a valid Re-Entry Permit, you may return to Singapore without the need for any entry approval. However, you will be subjected to the prevailing Stay-Home Notice requirements after arriving in Singapore. You may wish to refer to [safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health](/health) for details and updates on border control measures as well as [safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/shn](/health/shn) for information on the prevailing health measures for Singapore Citizens and PRs returning from abroad.

If you are a Singapore PR employed in Singapore, you may also use the PCA to return to Singapore. Singapore PRs who enter with or without PCA will be subjected to the same border health treatment in Singapore, except that Singapore PRs working in Singapore have the option to apply for PCA through their Singapore employers to facilitate their home leave in Malaysia. Your employer would have to apply for a PCA pass on your behalf at https://go.gov.sg/pcamsia. For Singapore PRs who apply for PCA, they will also have to adhere to the PCA Requirements and Process at https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/pca/requirements-and-process.

#### 4. I am a Singapore Citizen who is currently in Malaysia. Do I need the PCA to return to Singapore?

For Singapore citizens, you <u><b>do not</b></u> need any entry approval to return to Singapore. However, you will be subject to the prevailing Stay-Home Notice requirements after arriving in Singapore. You may wish to refer to [safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health](/health) for details and updates on border control measures, as well as [www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19/shn](https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19/shn) for more information about SHN issued by ICA.

#### 5. I am a Malaysian citizen and a Singapore PR. I am currently in Singapore but I want to return to Malaysia. Do I need the PCA to return to Malaysia?

Entry into Malaysia is governed by the Malaysian authorities. You may wish to reach out to the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs <https://www.kln.gov.my>, the Malaysian Immigration Department <https://www.imi.gov.my> or the Malaysian High Commission in Singapore <https://www.kln.gov.my/web/sgp_singapore> for further advice.

If you wish to return to Malaysia for short-term home leave, and re-enter Singapore after your short-term home leave, you are strongly encouraged to apply for the Singapore-issued PCA before leaving Singapore. 

The Singapore-issued PCA may be required by the Malaysian authorities for you to be exempted from the 14-day Home Surveillance Order (HSO)* in Malaysia. However, you may be required to undertake a COVID-19 PCR test within 24 hours of arrival in Malaysia and self-isolate while waiting for the test results.

*<i>The longest duration of a short-term home leave while being exempted from the HSO is less than or equals to 60 days, subject to when the application is approved. Please note that you are not required to indicate your date of entry to Malaysia for the application.</i>

Singapore PRs working in Singapore also have the option to apply for PCA through their Singapore employers to facilitate their home leave in Malaysia. For Singapore PRs who apply for PCA, they will also have to adhere to the PCA [Requirements and Process](/pca/requirements-and-process). 

#### 6. I am a Singapore Citizen/PR holding a Malaysia Work Pass. I am currently based in Singapore and I wish to return to Malaysia for business and work purposes. Can I use the PCA to return to Malaysia?

Yes, you may use the PCA to return to Malaysia. If your trip to Malaysia is less than 14 days, you may use the RGL.

Information on entering Malaysia is available on the Malaysian Immigration Department’s webpage (<https://www.imi.gov.my/portal2017/index.php/ms/sumber-dan-arkib/pengumuman/1833-Malaysia-Singapore-border-crossing-arrangement.html>)

#### 16. What is the duration of stay in Singapore that my employee will be eligible for under PCA?  Can I extend the PCA period for my employee?

The duration of stay in Singapore is tied to the validity of the employee’s long-term work pass for business and work (for employees who are work pass holders), or the validity of the employee’s PR status in Singapore (for employees who are Singapore PRs).

Should the employee leave Singapore, employers will only be able to apply for a new PCA for their employee to re-enter Singapore 90 days after the date of his/her prior entry.

### **SHN in SHN Dedicated Facilities**

#### 45. What are dedicated SHN facilities?

To prevent potential spread of infection from PCA travellers who have a travel history to Malaysia, the Government has worked with hotel operators to provide dedicated facilities for the affected PCA travellers to serve their 14-day SHN. 
Transportation will be arranged to send the PCA travellers directly from the border checkpoint to the hotels. Each will have their own room/toilet, and will be provided all their meals, so that they may avoid physical contact with other individuals.

SHN dedicated hotels will be assigned to affected PCA travellers upon their arrival in Singapore. There will be no booking required.

A 14-day SHN at the dedicated SHN facility will cost S$2,000 (inclusive of GST).

Under the PCA, only immediate family members who arrive in Singapore on the same day are permitted to stay in the same SDF room (up to 2 pax). Immediate family members travelling into Singapore together will be sent to the same SDF. Upon arrival at the SDF, they can notify the hotel duty manager that they wish to share a room with their family member, even if they are from different companies.

### Recovered Travellers

#### 50. I was recently diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. When can I travel into Singapore?

You should schedule your travel into Singapore at least 21 days after your date of COVID-19 diagnosis, based on your first positive PCR test. For example, if the date of your swab which yielded your first positive PCR test is on 1 Nov (Day 1), you should only depart for Singapore on 22 Nov (Day 22) and onwards. You should not travel if feeling unwell.

Travellers with a recent diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in the past 21 days may be denied entry into Singapore at the checkpoints. 

#### 51. I have recovered from COVID-19, am I required to undergo the pre-departure test before entry into Singapore? 

Individuals who were previously diagnosed with COVID-19 infection will still be required to take a COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours before departure for Singapore. Children aged 6 and below (in the calendar year) are currently exempted from the pre-departure PCR test. If the pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test result is positive, the recovered individual must also provide documentary proof of his/her past diagnosis of COVID-19, based on his/her first ever positive PCR test result. The date of the first ever positive PCR test result must be between 22 to 180 days prior to the date of arrival in Singapore. The documentary proof should be presented to the immigration officers at the checkpoints in Singapore.
