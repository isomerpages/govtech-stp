### 1. Qualifying as a transit traveller

<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;"><b>Transit travellers are defined as those travelling to another country via Singapore, <u>without clearing Singapore arrival immigration</u>.</b></p> 
	
<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;"><b>Transit travellers do not need proof of vaccination, COVID-19 tests, travel visas or entry approvals.</b> However, travellers who transit in Singapore Changi Airport must have their flights booked on the same itinerary, in order to ensure that their checked-in luggage can be tagged-through from the origin airport to their final destination. Travelling with flights operated by different airlines on the same journey is allowed, if the flights are made under the same booking.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;"><b>Travellers who intend to clear arrival immigration to enter Singapore, or booked flights which require them to enter Singapore to collect tickets or baggage and check-in again for the connecting flight, are <u>not</u> considered transit travellers.</b> Several Low Cost Carriers require travellers to clear immigration to collect their onward connecting tickets in the Departure Check-In hall. Such travellers should ensure that they fulfil all requirements found on the “<a href="/arriving/overview" target="_blank">Travelling to Singapore</a>” page, including entryvisas and submission of the SG Arrival Card.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">For more information about Singapore Changi Airport’s transit area, including shopping and dining options within the departure transit area, please check the <a href="https://www.changiairport.com/en/airport-guide/Covid-19/transiting-through-airport.html" target="_blank">Changi Airport website</a>.</p>

### 2. Transit travellers must fulfil destination country requirements

<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;"><b>Please note that the authorities of the destination country may impose requirements on travellers transiting in Singapore, which travellers also have to comply with.</b> As an illustration, if travellers intend to depart from <b><i>Country X</i></b>, transit in Singapore, and fly to destination <b><i>Country Y</i></b>, they are strongly advised to check the requirements of <b><i>Country Y</i></b>, such as:</p>

<ol style="padding-left:20px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; list-style-type: lower-latin;">
  <li style="padding-left:20px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;"><b>Acceptance of transit travellers:</b> Whether the authorities of destination <b><i>Country Y</i></b> accept travellers transiting through Singapore, including whether they impose requirements on using certain flights for transit.  </li>
  <li style="padding-left:20px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;"><b>Entry requirements:</b> Whether the authorities of destination <b><i>Country Y</i></b> impose conditions of entry such as visas, entry approvals, vaccinations or other documentation. The airline will check upon boarding if you have the relevant documentation on hand.</li>
    <li style="padding-left:20px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;"><b>Pre-departure testing (PDT) requirements:</b> If <b><i>Country Y</i></b> requires travellers to take a COVID-19 test for entry into <b><i>Country Y</i></b>. Such COVID-19 tests are <u>not</u> available in the transit area of Changi Airport and travellers should take their PDT in <b><i>Country X</i></b>, if <b><i>Country Y</i></b> requires them to do so.</li>
