### 1. Qualifying as a transit traveller

<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;"><b>Transit travellers refer to those who depart for a third country via Singapore <u>without clearing arrival immigration</u>. Singapore does not require COVID-19 tests, travel visas or entry approvals for transit travellers.</b> However, travellers who transit in Changi must have their flights booked on the same itinerary, in order to ensure that their checked-in luggage can be tagged-through from the origin airport to their final destination. Travelling with flights operated by different airlines on the same journey is allowed, so long as the flights are made under the same booking. Travellers interested in connecting through Changi Airport should consult their airline on the options available.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;"><b>Travellers who intend to clear arrival immigration to enter Singapore, or booked separate flights under different itineraries, which requires them to enter Singapore to collect baggage and check-in again for the connecting flight, are not considered transit travellers.</b> They are responsible for ensuring that they fulfill all requirements for entry into Singapore, and should refer to the “<a href="/arriving/overview" target="_blank">Travelling to Singapore</a>” page for more information on entry requirements.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">For more information about Singapore Changi Airport’s transit area, including shopping and dining options within the departure transit area, please check the <a href="https://www.changiairport.com/en/airport-guide/Covid-19/transiting-through-airport.html" target="_blank">Changi Airport website</a>.</p>

### 2. Transit travellers must fulfil destination country requirements

<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;"><b>Please note that the authorities of the destination country may impose requirements on travellers transiting in Singapore, which travellers also have to comply with.</b> As an illustration, if travellers intend to depart from <b><i>Country X</i></b>, transit in Singapore, and fly to destination <b><i>Country Y</i></b>, they are strongly advised to check the requirements of <b><i>Country Y</i></b>, such as:</p>

<ol style="padding-left:20px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; list-style-type: lower-latin;">
  <li style="padding-left:20px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;"><b>Acceptance of transit travellers:</b> Whether the authorities of destination <b><i>Country Y</i></b> accept travellers transiting through Singapore, including whether they impose requirements on using certain flights for transit.  </li>
  <li style="padding-left:20px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;"><b>Entry requirements:</b> Whether the authorities of destination <b><i>Country Y</i></b> impose conditions of entry such as visas, entry approvals, vaccinations or other documentation. The airline will check upon boarding if you have the relevant documentation on hand.</li>
    <li style="padding-left:20px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;"><b>Pre-departure testing (PDT) requirements:</b> If <b><i>Country Y</i></b> requires travellers to take a COVID-19 test for entry into <b><i>Country Y</i></b>. Such COVID-19 tests are <u>not</u> available in the transit area of Changi Airport and travellers should take their PDT in <b><i>Country X</i></b>, if <b><i>Country Y</i></b> requires them to do so.</li>
