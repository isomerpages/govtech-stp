## **Application Process for Residents in the Republic of Korea (ROK)**

### **Application**

#### 1. Who is eligible to apply to travel to Singapore under the fast lane?

Persons of all nationalities who are legally resident in the ROK and who need to make single-entry, short-term essential travel for business or official purposes between Singapore and the ROK.

#### 2. I am a Singapore Citizen / Singapore Permanent Resident / Singapore Long-Term Pass holder* who is resident in the ROK. Am I eligible to apply for the fast lane?

Yes. All residents in the ROK who need to make short-term essential business or official travel between Singapore and the ROK are eligible to apply for the fast lane.

<p style="font-size: 1.0rem; line-height: 1.8rem;"><em>*Singapore Long-Term Pass holders who are eligible to apply for fast lane travel include holders of MOM-issued work passes (e.g. Employment Pass, EntrePass, Personalised Employment Pass, S Pass, Work Permit, Dependant’s Pass) and holders of the ICA-issued Long-Term Visit Pass.</em></p>

<p style="font-size: 1.0rem; line-height: 1.8rem;"><em>Long-Term Pass holders returning to Singapore after a visit to the ROK via the fast lane should identify themselves as fast lane travellers during pre-departure airline checks in the ROK, and to ICA at Singapore immigration by presenting the letter issued by the ROK Embassy that will allow them to take a pre-departure test in Singapore.</em></p>

#### 3. What is a SafeTravel Pass?

A SafeTravel Pass is required for residents in the ROK to seek entry into Singapore under the fast lane. It is non-transferable and will be valid for a single entry into Singapore anytime within the stipulated week (0000hrs Monday to 2359hrs Sunday). Travellers must enter Singapore within this stipulated week, and can stay in Singapore for the duration of their Visit Pass issued at the immigration checkpoint in Singapore.

SafeTravel Passes will be issued on a limited basis in order to manage the risk of imported COVID-19 cases.

Please send an email to <COVID_SafeTravelEnquiries@mti.gov.sg> if you have further queries related to the SafeTravel Pass.

#### 4. How do residents in the ROK apply to travel to Singapore under the fast lane? What are the steps from the time I put in an application to the time I obtain a visa? How long is the processing time? What documents do I need to submit?

Residents in the ROK seeking to travel to Singapore via the fast lane must be hosted by a company or a government agency in Singapore. The host company can file the application for a SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller either directly at <https://go.gov.sg/rglapp>, or through a sponsoring government agency.

The application for the SafeTravel Pass will be open 20 working days (excluding the date of application and date of entry) before the day of the traveller’s planned departure. The processing of the application can take up to 7 working days. Applications submitted less than 7 working days from the planned departure will not be accepted.

You are encouraged to apply for the SafeTravel Pass as early as possible, factoring in the time necessary for the processing of the SafeTravel Pass application, visa application (if needed) and taking a pre-departure COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test before departure for Singapore.

When the SafeTravel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be issued to the applicant and the sponsoring company / government agency by email. With this letter, an approved applicant who is a visa-required passport holder will proceed to apply for a visa for travel to Singapore through the usual channels (Singapore overseas missions, authorised visa agents, local contact or companies) at least 4 working days before departure. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status [here](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save).

Those who did not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will not need to apply for a visa for fast lane travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

The approved applicant will have to submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations as well as declare his/her accommodation electronically via the SG Arrival Card, within 3 days prior to the date of arrival in Singapore.

Prior to the traveller’s departure from the ROK, the sponsoring company or government agency should submit the traveller’s **certificate of negative result for COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours before departure** and the **controlled itinerary in Singapore** at <https://go.gov.sg/rglsuppdocs>.

The traveller is required to present his/her valid SafeTravel Pass, certificate of negative result for a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, return air ticket or proof of other transportation arrangements to depart Singapore, and valid visa (for visa-required passport holders) for pre-boarding checks at the airlines check-in counter and immigration counter. Otherwise, he/she may be refused boarding.

#### 5. What are the responsibilities of the host company who is self-sponsoring?

When a company applies for the SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller, it is also responsible for the timely submission of the accompanying documents.

The host company should also ensure that the traveller abides by the terms and conditions of the Singapore-ROK Fast Lane, and the prevailing health measures during his/her stay in Singapore. Authorities may ask for proof of adherence to the controlled itinerary, including physical verification or SafeEntry Pass records (e.g. screenshots), and other terms and conditions when the traveller is in Singapore.

You can access the terms and conditions of the Singapore-ROK Fast Lane at <https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/rok/rgl/terms-and-conditions>. Action will be taken against the traveller and the host company in the event of non-compliance.

#### 6. Can tourists apply for SafeTravel Passes?

SafeTravel Passes are only issued to travellers making short-term essential business and official travel. These passes are not applicable for tourists.

#### 7. Can my SafeTravel Pass be transferred to my family member, friend, colleague or business partner?

SafeTravel Passes are not transferable to others.

#### 8. Do I need to pay to apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

No payment is required.

#### 9. Is there a limit to the number of times I can apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

There is no limit to the number of times a traveller can apply for a SafeTravel Pass. Every entry to Singapore requires a new SafeTravel Pass application.

If the traveller’s SafeTravel Pass has expired, he/she should submit a new application.

One traveller can only hold one valid SafeTravel Pass **for a single entry into Singapore** at any one point in time. Please refrain from submitting multiple SafeTravel Pass applications or submitting new applications when you already have a valid SafeTravel Pass on hand. Duplicate applications will be rejected.

#### 10. What visa will I be eligible for under the fast lane, and what is the duration of stay that I will be eligible for in Singapore?

Every application for a visa, including the type of visa granted, will be considered on its own merits and subject to approval. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/ she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status [here](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save).

Those who did not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will not need to apply for a visa for fast lane travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

Travellers who are granted entry into Singapore are generally issued with a Visit Pass, of which the duration would be aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### 11. How can I further extend my Visit Pass / stay when I am in Singapore, if necessary?

All applications for extension of Visit Pass must be submitted online using ICA’s e-Service (<https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/extend>) at least seven days prior to the expiry of the Visit Pass to avoid overstaying. Extension of Visit Pass will not be accepted over the counter. Each application is considered on its own merits.

#### 12. My travel plans have changed/ some information in my application is incorrect. How can I amend the details of my SafeTravel Pass application/ approved SafeTravel Pass?

Both the SafeTravel Pass application and issued SafeTravel Pass cannot be amended. Please ensure that all details of the application form are accurate at the point of submission.

#### 13. What can I do if I have changes to my controlled itinerary?

The host company should be responsible for monitoring and reporting any deviation in your controlled itinerary. The host company should resubmit the updated controlled itinerary on behalf of the traveller via the ‘Submission of Supporting Documents for SafeTravel Pass Application’ Form, at <https://go.gov.sg/rglsuppdocs>. This should be done even if the traveller is already in Singapore. Please ensure that the amendments or deviation from the controlled itinerary are in accordance with the stipulated guidelines.

#### 14. Why was my application rejected?

SafeTravel Pass applications may be rejected for reasons, including the following:
- **The quota for the week of entry that the application was submitted was fully utilised.** In this situation, you may consider submitting an application for a SafeTravel Pass for a different week of entry.
- **Application exceeds permissible window, i.e. not within 20 to 7 working days prior to departure.** In this situation, please ensure that you submit the application earliest 20 working days prior to the date of entry into Singapore, and latest 7 working days before the date of entry into Singapore.
- **Inadequate information provided.**

#### 15. I have submitted the necessary supporting documents prior to my departure from the ROK to Singapore. Why did I receive a notification that the submission was unsuccessful?

You might have submitted the supporting documents earlier than the 72-hour window before the declared date of departure from the ROK. You should submit the supporting documents only after receiving the results of the COVID-19 PCR test which has to be taken <u>within 72 hours</u> of departure from the ROK. Please resubmit the necessary documents within the stipulated window prior to departure.

Do also ensure that the supporting documents submitted are in the correct format (pdf., jpeg).

### **Health Measures in Singapore**

#### 23. What health measures will I be subjected to upon arrival in Singapore?

Fast lane travellers from the ROK must take a PCR test after arrival in Singapore, and remain isolated in a declared self-sourced accommodation (non-residential address only) until their test results are released (typically within 48 hours). Transportation from the airport to the declared accommodation will have to be provided by the host company or government agency subject to prevailing health measures.<sup>2</sup> Travellers will bear the costs of the post-arrival PCR test in Singapore and stay in the declared accommodation.

If the result indicates that the traveller has tested negative for COVID-19, the host company or government agency will ensure that the traveller is transported directly from the declared accommodation to the workplace and back according to the submitted controlled itinerary for the first 14 days of the traveller’s stay in Singapore. The traveller may not use public transportation for this purpose, with the exception of private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport.<sup>3</sup>

Travellers to Singapore must use the TraceTogether app and SafeEntry<sup>4</sup>, take their temperature twice daily, report their health status to the host company or government agency, and adhere to prevailing public health requirements for the duration of their stay in Singapore.

#### 24. What is the TraceTogether app? Does the Singapore Government track my movements via the app?

The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s phone, and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data.

The app works best on phones with Android version 5.1 and above. More information on the app can be found at <https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg>.

#### 25. What is SafeEntry?

SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that logs the NRIC/FINs and mobile numbers of individuals visiting hotspots, workplaces of essential services, as well as selected public venues to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 through activities such as contact tracing and identification of COVID-19 clusters.

More information can be found at <https://www.safeentry.gov.sg>.

### **Returning to the ROK**

#### 26. Do I need to be tested again in Singapore before I return to the ROK? Do I need to be quarantined or be tested again upon return to the ROK?

Fast lane returnees to the ROK currently do not need to be tested again in Singapore before returning to the ROK.

Upon their arrival back in the ROK, they must adhere to the prevailing COVID-19 prevention and control measures of the ROK Government. This may include a 14-day quarantine or COVID-19 tests.

As the specific requirements may change over time, the returnee should verify the latest requirements with the ROK Government.

#### 27. What are the requirements for re-entry into the ROK?

Foreign nationals with long-term residency in the ROK are required to obtain a re-entry permit before leaving the ROK. A re-entry permit allows the holder to re-enter the ROK once within the period of permission.

Please call the clinic and book your test slot before the Cut-off Test Timing in the schedule above. This is to ensure that you will have sufficient time to meet the fast lane requirements.

##### 4. How far in advance should I make an appointment for the pre-departure PCR test?

Due to limited slots, please make your appointment with the clinic as early as possible, once your flight timing and fast lane application is approved.

Please refer to the **Schedule for the “Latest Cut-off Test Timing” and book your test slot within the indicated timing.** This is to ensure that you meet the fast lane requirements.

If you do not make a prior appointment, please note that:
1. There is no guarantee that there will be a test slot for you; and 
2. You may not get your results in time for your flight to qualify for fast lane arrangements.

Travellers who miss the cut-off test timing will not be able to obtain a test result in time for their flight.

##### 5. What details will I need to book an appointment for the PCR test?

Please have the following information on hand when making an appointment for your test:
1. Identity card number or passport number
2. Departure flight timing
3. Possible times for your test slot: Please refer to the Test Schedule to confirm your timing
4. Address in Singapore 
5. Contact number 
6. Email address

1. Identity card or passport 
2. Letter issued by the ROK Embassy in Singapore confirming that you have been granted approval by the relevant authorities in the ROK to travel to the ROK under the Singapore-ROK Fast Lane. 
3. Softcopy booking reference showing your departure flight timing

##### Testing

##### 7. What if I miss my test timing? What if I take my test after the Cut-off Test Timing?

Travellers who miss the Cut-off Test Timing will <u>not</u> be able to obtain a test result in time for their flight.

Please make arrangements early for your test slot so that you can qualify for the fast lane arrangements.

##### 8. What happens if the clinic assesses that I am unable to receive the PCR test for unforeseen circumstances?

If you are unable to receive the test, you may wish to reschedule your flight, if you still wish to tap on the fast lane arrangement.

##### Test Results

##### 9. When can I expect to get my PCR test results?

You will receive your PCR test results and memo at least three hours before your flight.

The clinic will email the results to your email address. You will need to print and bring the memo overseas yourself.
