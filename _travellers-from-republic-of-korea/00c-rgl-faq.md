SafeTravel Passes will be issued on a limited basis in order to manage the risk of imported COVID-19 cases.

Please send an email to <COVID_SafeTravelEnquiries@mti.gov.sg> if you have further queries related to the SafeTravel Pass.

Residents in the ROK seeking to travel to Singapore via the fast lane must be hosted by a company or a government agency in Singapore. The host company can file the application for a SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller either directly at <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO>, or through a sponsoring government agency.

When applying for the SafeTravel Pass, Proof of Residency in the ROK is required. ROK citizens should present a copy of their passport page for submission, while foreign residents in ROK should present a copy of their Certificate of Alien Registration. The applicant will also be required to submit the controlled itinerary for the traveller(s)’ first 14 days of stay in Singapore, which is limited to travel between places of business and accommodation, with limited contact with the community.

The application for the SafeTravel Pass will be open 2 to 5 weeks before the week of the traveller’s planned departure. The processing of the application can take up to 7 days (excluding the day of application). You are encouraged to apply for the SafeTravel Pass as early as possible, factoring in the time necessary for the processing of the SafeTravel Pass application, visa application (if needed) and taking a pre-departure COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.

When the SafeTravel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be issued to the sponsoring company / government agency by email within 3 working days. With this letter, an approved applicant who is a visa-required passport holder will proceed to apply for a visa for travel to Singapore through the usual channels (Singapore overseas missions, authorised visa agents, local contact or companies) at least 4 working days before departure. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status through [here](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save).

Those who did not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will not need to apply for a visa for fast lane travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

The approved applicant will have to submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations as well as declare his/her accommodation electronically via the SG Arrival Card, within 3 days prior to the date of arrival in Singapore.

Prior to the traveller’s departure from the ROK, the sponsoring company or government agency should submit the traveller’s **certificate of negative result for COVID-19 test** taken within 72 hours before departure and **latest** controlled itinerary at <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO>.

Travellers by air are required to present their valid SafeTravel Pass, valid visa (for visa-required passport holders), return air ticket and negative result for a COVID-19 PCR test for pre-boarding checks at the airlines’ check-in counter and immigration counter. Otherwise, he/she may be refused boarding.

#### 5. What are the responsibilities of the host company?

When a company applies for the SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller, it is also responsible for the timely submission of the accompanying documents.

The host company should also ensure that the traveller abides by the terms and conditions of the Singapore-ROK Fast Lane, and the prevailing health measures during his/her stay in Singapore. Authorities may ask for proof of adherence to the controlled itinerary, including physical verification or SafeEntry Pass records (e.g. screenshots), and other terms and conditions when the traveller is in Singapore.

You can access the terms and conditions of the Singapore-ROK Fast Lane at <https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/rok/rgl/terms-and-conditions>. Action will be taken against the traveller and the host company in the event of non-compliance.

SafeTravel Passes are only issued to travellers making short-term essential business and official travel. These passes are not applicable for tourists.

#### 7. Can my SafeTravel Pass be transferred to my family member, friend, colleague or business partner?

SafeTravel Passes are not transferable to others.

If the traveller’s SafeTravel Pass has expired, he/she should submit a new application.

#### 10. What visa will I be eligible for under the fast lane, and what is the duration of stay that I will be eligible for in Singapore?

Every application for a visa, including the type of visa granted, will be considered on its own merits and subject to approval. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/ she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status [here](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save).

Those who did not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will not need to apply for a visa for fast lane travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

Travellers who are granted entry into Singapore are generally issued with a Visit Pass, of which the duration would be aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### 11. How can I further extend my Visit Pass / stay when I am in Singapore, if necessary?

All applications for extension of Visit Pass must be submitted online using ICA’s e-Service (<https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/extend>) at least seven days prior to the expiry of the Visit Pass to avoid overstaying.

The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s phone, and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data.

The app works best on phones with Android version 5.1 and above. More information on the app can be found at <https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg>.
