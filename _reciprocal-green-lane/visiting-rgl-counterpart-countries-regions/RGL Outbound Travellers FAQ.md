The relevant Indonesian Government authorities will assess each application on a case-by-case basis. 

#### 2. How do Singapore residents apply to travel to Indonesia under the RGL? 

Residents in Singapore seeking to travel to Indonesia for short-term essential business or official travel via the RGL must be sponsored by either a company or a government agency in Indonesia. On behalf of the traveller, the sponsor will apply online for an Indonesian visa from the Directorate General of Immigration of Indonesia at <https://visa-online.imigrasi.go.id/>. The visa application should be submitted at least 7 working days before the intended date of entry into Indonesia. Visa requirements include: (a) health certificate indicating that the traveller is free of respiratory symptoms and fit to travel; (b) consent letter to undergo mandatory self-isolation or medical treatment, if the traveller is tested positive for COVID-19 upon arrival in Indonesia; (c) consent letter to be monitored during quarantine or self-isolation in accordance with Indonesian laws and regulations; (d) health or travel insurance covering medical expenses and/or a declaration letter to bear the cost of medical treatment if the traveller contracts COVID-19 in Indonesia; and (e) proof of funds by the sponsor (at least US$10,000) to support the traveller’s living expenses in Indonesia. Visa application fees include a telex visa / visa aproval fee (IDR 200,000) and a visitor visa fee (US$50). The result of the visa application will be conveyed 2 to 3 days after payment has been made. After the visa application is approved, the visa will be sent electronically to the traveller. 

The traveller should work with his/her Indonesian sponsor to verify that he/she has fulfilled the RGL requirements of the Indonesian authorities prior to departure for Indonesia. This includes taking a pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test at least once within 72 hours before departure, and obtaining a negative test result from healthcare institutions in Singapore listed at [ANNEX C](#annexcindon). The traveller must have remained in Singapore for at least 14 days prior to departure, monitor their health status before departure from Singapore, and not depart for Indonesia if feeling unwell.

If RGL travellers intend to travel domestically in Indonesia after 14 days, they are required to renew their health certificate, by undergoing a new PCR/rapid test. The PCR test should be taken at the list of healthcare institutions listed in [Annex A](#annexaindon). The rapid test can be taken at any laboratory in Indonesia.
