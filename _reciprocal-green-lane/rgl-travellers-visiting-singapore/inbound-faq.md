<div id="General"></div>

### A) General Queries

#### 1. What is a SafeTravel Pass under the RGL arrangement for travel to Singapore?

The SafeTravel Pass issued under the RGL arrangement is a non-transferrable single-entry travel document. It allows a traveller to seek short-term essential business and official visit into Singapore within a stipulated week (0000 hours Monday to 2359 hours Sundays), where he/she can remain in Singapore for the duration stipulated in the visit pass issued at the immigration counters of Singapore.

#### 2. Is there a limit to the number of times I can apply for a SafeTravel Pass under the RGL arrangement?

There is no limit to the number of times a traveller can be sponsored for a SafeTravel Pass under the RGL arrangement. However, as each SafeTravel pass is only valid for single-entry into Singapore, each new entry will require a fresh application by the sponsor. While there is no cap on the number of times a traveller can be sponsored for entry under the RGL, there may be penalties in repeated cases of non-utilisation (i.e. no show).

#### 3. I intend to visit Singapore, but I do not qualify for RGL. Is there another SafeTravel Pass that I apply for entry into Singapore? 

You can check [here](/arriving/overview) for the available SafeTravel lanes to visit Singapore. Prospective travellers cannot apply for the SafeTravel Pass-RGL themselves; all RGL applications must be submitted by a company or government agency in Singapore via this [link](http://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO).

#### 4. I was recently diagnosed with COVID-19 but am scheduled to travel to Singapore. Can I still visit Singapore?

In general, travellers who are unwell should seek for immediate medical attention and defer their travels. Travellers diagnosed with COVID-19 less than 21 days before the scheduled date of arrival in Singapore will not be permitted travel to Singapore; airlines will deny such travellers from boarding.

#### 6. What is the application window and processing time for the SafeTravel Pass application under the RGL arrangement?

The application for the SafeTravel Pass is open for a period of two to five weeks before the week of the traveller’s planned departure to Singapore. As applications can take up to seven days (excluding the day of application) to process, any application submitted less than eight days from the planned date of entry will not be accepted.

Application sponsors should apply for the SafeTravel Pass-RGL as soon as practicable. Sponsors should take into consideration the time involved forapplication and visa processing (if required), as well as the mandatory pre-departure COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”) before departure for Singapore. That aside, application sponsors should note that the hosting company or government agency must submit a copy of the traveller’s 14-day controlled itinerary at least a day before the travellers’ arrival in Singapore.

#### 7. How will I be notified of the outcome of the SafeTravel Pass application?

The applicant sponsor will be notified of the outcome of the SafeTravel Pass application via the email provided in the application. 

Sponsors may also enquire about the application status [here](http://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO) using the traveller’s identification details and intended date of arrival in Singapore.

#### 8. I noticed a mistake in the application that I had submitted. What should I do to address the error? 

Amendments cannot be made once an application is submitted . Application sponsors should therefore ensure that all application details are accurate at the point of submission.

#### 9. What should I do if there are changes in the 14-day controlled itinerary submitted?

As a condition for entry into Singapore, travellers approved under the RGL arrangement must adhere to the controlled itinerary submitted. Failure to do so can result in the immediate revocation of the SafeTravel Pass and termination of the visit pass. Application sponsors should therefore ensure that the controlled itinerary submitted is accurate. Should there be any changes in the itinerary, application sponsors can submit the webform at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry">https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry</a> with the approved SafeTravel Pass reference and revised controlled itinerary. 

#### 10. Why was my application rejected?

Safe Travel Pass applications may be rejected for one or more of the following reasons:
- Inadequate justifications for reason of travel
- Non-compliant 14-day controlled itinerary
- Invalid proof of residency
- Insufficient quota for the intended week of entry

### C) For RGL Travellers

<div id="visa"></div>

### Visa Applications and Visit Pass Extensions

#### 11. How do I know if I need a visa to visit Singapore? If I need a visa, how can I apply for one? 

Travellers should check [here](https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteringanddeparting/before/entryvisa/) on whether a visa is required for their entry into Singapore. 

Travellers from visa-exempted countries do not need to apply for a visa. However, travellers who that require a visa to enter Singapore, can apply for a visa through the Singapore overseas missions, authorised visa agents, a local contact or company at least four working days before departure to Singapore; the granting of visas will depend on the merits of each application.

#### 12. How do I extend my visit pass/stay in Singapore, if necessary?

Requests to extend the visit pass/stay in Singapore must be made at least seven days before the expiry of the visit pass. An application for extension can be only be submitted online using ICA’s [e-Service](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/extend), and the granting of extension will depend on the merits of each application. ICA no longer accepts over the counter extension requests.

<div id="pre-departure"></div>

### Mandatory Pre-Departure to Singapore Preparation 

#### 13. What pre-departure requirements must I comply with before entering Singapore?

Three days before the travellers’ scheduled entry into Singapore, the application sponsor must submit the following:
- Pre-trip health and travel history declarations and accommodation details electronically via the [SG Arrival Card](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/); and
- Traveller’s certificate of negative test result for COVID-19 (taken within 72 hours before departure at authorised testing facilities), and latest 14-day controlled itinerary in Singapore [here](http://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO).

#### 14. What documents do I need show to the airline during boarding and at Singapore’s immigration checkpoint?

RGL travellers entering Singapore via air and land transport must produce the following documents:
- A valid SafeTravel Pass approval letter (the date of entry to Singapore must fall within the period of entry stated in the letter).
- A valid visa to enter Singapore (for visa-required passport holders who are short-term visitors to Singapore).
- A valid certificate of negative result for a COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours before departure for Singapore (the certificate must be issued by an authorised COVID-19 testing facility designated by the government of the country/region the traveller is departing from). The certificate should also be in English or accompanied with an English translation. It should also contain the (i) Traveller's name, Date of Birth or Passport number (per passport used to travel to Singapore); and (ii) Date and result of the PCR test. 
- Proof of return transportation arrangements to depart from Singapore (e.g. air, train and bus return ticket). Travellers arriving by air who do not produce a return air ticket during pre-boarding checks may be refused boarding.

### COVID-19 Test on Arrival in Singapore

#### 15. What COVID-19 tests am I required to take upon arrival in Singapore? Where will the tests be administered, and what are the available payment modes?

All RGL travellers are required to take a COVID-19 PCR test (S$125) upon arrival. Travellers entering Singapore by air are encouraged to [pre-register and pre-pay](https://safetravel.changiairport.com/) for the PCR test.

In general, travellers should, upon arrival, identify themselves as travellers of the RGL scheme to an airport or checkpoint officer. Upon confirmation of their RGL approved status, travellers will be brought to the swabbing station within Changi Airport in Singapore for the test.

#### 16. What happens if I test positive for COVID-19 in Singapore? Do I have to pay for my COVID-19 medical bills?

Travellers who test positive for COVID-19 will be given medical attention/treatment immediately. The cost of the relevant medical treatments will be borne in full by the travellers. As such travellers are required be insured for any COVID-19 related medical treatment before travelling to Singapore. Click [here](/health/insurance-and-treatment) for more information on this requirement.

<div id ="publichealth"></div>

### Public Health Safeguards in Singapore

#### 17. What health measures will I be subjected to upon arrival in Singapore?

Travellers should refer to the relevant Terms & Conditions, for details on the health measures that they must observe upon arrival in Singapore. Travellers can click [here](/rgl/overview#conditions) to view the Terms and Conditions.

In general, RGL travellers must take a COVID-19 PCR Test upon arrival in Singapore. After undergoing the test, the RGL travellers will commute directly from the immigration checkpoint to the declared self-sourced (non-residential) accommodation through a dedicated vehicle in the form of private transportation, taxi, or private hire car <u>pre-arranged</u> by the host. <b>The use of public transportation is not allowed.</b> RGL travellers must remain in their accommodation until a negative COVID-19 PCR test result is conveyed (typically within 24 hours). Travellers and application sponsors should note that the declared accommodation during the first 14 days of stay in Singapore must be a non-residential address. Any cost incurred, e.g. post-arrival PCR test in Singapore and stay in the declared accommodation, will be borne by the traveller. Failure to comply with any of these requirements may result in the immediate revocation of the Safe Travel Pass.

Travellers can leave their accommodation only if they are tested negative for COVID-19 in Singapore. All travellers are required to adhere strictly to the controlled itinerary submitted; access to common facilities/amenities in the declared accommodation, which is beyond the scope of his/her declared business activities in Singapore, is prohibited. Travellers are also prohibited from taking public transportation during their stay in Singapore and can only commute using private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport that the host company/government agency may arrange.

Travellers should take their temperature twice daily and report their health status to the host company/government agency. During their stay in Singapore, travellers must adhere to prevailing public health requirements, which includes the use of the TraceTogether mobile application and SafeEntry.

#### 18. What is the TraceTogether app? Does the Singapore Government track my movements via the app?

The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. Together with other digital contact tracing tools, TraceTogether's Bluetooth proximity data has helped to reduce average contact tracing time from 4 days to less than 1.5 days. 

The Bluetooth proximity data collected is stored locally in the user's phone. If the user test positive for COviD-19, the Singapore Ministry of Health will approach the user to upload their Bluetooth proximity data for contact tracing purposes. TraceTogether app does not collect or track your GPS location data. You may read more about our [Privacy Safeguards](https://tracetogether.gov.sg/common/privacystatement/).

The app works best on phones with Android version 5.1 and above, as well as phones with iOS version 10 and above. More information on the app can be found [here](https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/).

#### 19. Must every travellers download the TraceTogether app?

Yes. All travellers to Singapore must download the TraceTogether app prior to departing for Singapore.

#### 20. After downloading the TraceTogether app, how do I activate it?

#### 21. I have downloaded the TraceTogether app, but I cannot activate the app. What should I do?

Please check that your app has been updated to the latest version.

You can activate your app only <u>after</u> clearing Singapore immigration. There might be a short lag after clearing immigration before you can activate the app. 

If you still are unable to activate your app after immigration clearance, it could be because you did not register your profile with the same identification number, nationality and date of birth as those shown in the passport that you have used to enter Singapore. Follow the instructions to be navigated back to the Holding Screen.

You can edit your passport details by clicking the ‘edit’ button on the Holding Screen, as indicated below.

If you still face issues, please email <support@tracetogether.gov.sg> with your query and details of the issue you are facing, or call the support helpline at +65 6973 6511 during operating hours.

#### 22. If I change my mobile device on SIM card when I arrive in Singapore, do I need to download the TraceTogether app again?

If you change your mobile device, you are required to download the TraceTogether app again on your new mobile device and activate it by following the instructions that appear when you launch the app.

If you change your SIM card but are still using the same mobile device, you will not need to download the TraceTogether app again.

Please ensure that you keep your mobile device's Bluetooth function turned on so that the TraceTogether app remains activated throughout your stay in Singapore.

#### 23. What happens if travellers do not have mobile devices to download the TraceTogether app?

All travellers must have a mobile device to download the TraceTogether app from the [iOS Play Store](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/tracetogether/id1498276074) and [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.gov.tech.bluetrace) and Huawei App Gallery. Travellers should consider renting a TraceTogether-compatible mobile device if they do not have one.

Alternatively, travellers may also obtain a TraceTogether token. Click <a href="/faq#TT" target="_blank">here</a> for more information. 


#### 24. Can travellers switch off their mobile devices while in Singapore?

No, travellers must keep their mobile devices and the Bluetooth function switched on at all times while in Singapore.


#### 25. What is SafeEntry?

SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that logs the NRIC/FIN and mobile numbers of individuals visiting hotspots, workplaces of essential services, as well as selected public venues to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 through activities such as contact tracing and identification of COVID-19 clusters.

An existing check-in method is via scanning of a QR code at the venue with a camera phone or a QR scanner app. Hence, you are encouraged to purchase a Singapore local data SIM card, or connect your mobile phone to a Singapore local Wi-Fi network to access the form for this mode of check-in.

Alternatively, some venues allow you to complete SafeEntry by presenting your passport as identification. Establishments will assist travellers with manual SafeEntry check-in.

More information on the system can be found [here](https://www.safeentry.gov.sg/).


#### 26. I was identified as a close contact of a confirmed COVID-19 case. What does it mean?

Close contacts of an active COVID-19 case will be identified by MOH through contact tracing. Individuals assess to be a close contact of an active COVID-19 case may be issued a quarantine order (QO) under the Infectious Diseases Act. Click [here](https://www.gov.sg/article/everything-you-need-to-know-about-quarantine-orders) for more on the QO. Affected travellers should extend their visit pass, if duration of the QO exceeds the visit pass’ validity period. 

#### 27. Can I visit the convenient store/shopping mall/supermarket to purchase daily necessity or business-related items?

No, travellers should seek assistance from their Host to make the purchases on their behalf to limit the contact with the local community. Any deviation from controlled itinerary may result in the cancellation of Visit Pass.

#### 28. What happens if I do not comply with the terms and conditions for the SafeTravel Pass? 

The Singapore Government takes a serious view of non-compliance with SafeTravel terms and conditions and prevailing health measures. Non-compliance with any of the conditions of the SafeTravel Pass may result in refusal of entry into Singapore and/or cancellation of the SafeTravel Pass. The traveller and the Host shall be jointly liable for and bear all costs incurred for the cost of repatriation, as well as cost of custody and care pending repatriation. Future SafeTravel Pass applications may also be rejected. 


<div id="return"></div>

### Return to Countries/Regions of Departure

#### 30. Do I need to be tested again before I return to my origin country/region of departure? What health measures will I be subjected to upon return to my country/region of departure?

As the specific requirements may change over time, RGL travellers returning to their country/region of departure should verify the latest requirements with the respective country/region’s government.
