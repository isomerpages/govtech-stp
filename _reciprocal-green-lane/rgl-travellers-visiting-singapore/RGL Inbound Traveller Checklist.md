<div style="padding: 5px; font-size:16px; line-height:1.5; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; margin-bottom:10px; background-color:#f5f5f5;"><br>!! Readers who have arrived at this page directly from search engine or are new to the entry requirements imposed by Singapore, should start from the “<a href="/arriving/overview">Travelling to Singapore</a>" page found on this site. The self-help tool found on the page will help travellers identify the most suitable travel lane for their needs. Travellers who fail to comply with entry requirements will be turned away.

<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.5; margin-bottom:15px;">Travellers who have left Singapore via RGL and are returning to the country, do not need an entry approval to enter. However, they will be subject to the <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary">prevailing travel and health control measures</a> depending on which RGL country/region they visited.</p>
