Travellers must enter Singapore within this stipulated week, and can stay in Singapore for the duration of their Visit Pass issued to them at the immigration checkpoint in Singapore.

SafeTravel Passes will be issued on a limited basis in order to manage the risk of imported COVID-19 cases.

Please send an email to <COVID_SafeTravelEnquiries@mti.gov.sg> if you have further queries related to the SafeTravel Pass.

#### 4. Do Bruneian citizens and residents still need to apply to exit the country?

Yes, Brunei citizens and residents travelling to Singapore under the RGL will still need to apply for Exit Travel via Brunei’s PMO. Information on the application can be found on <http://www.pmo.gov.bn/travelportal/Home.aspx>

#### 5. How do residents in Brunei apply for a SafeTravel Pass to travel to Singapore under the RGL? What are the steps from the time I put in an application to the time I obtain a SafeTravel Pass? How long is the processing time? What documents do I need to submit?

Residents in Brunei seeking to travel to Singapore via the RGL must be hosted by a company or a government agency in Singapore. The host company can file the application for a SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller either directly at <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO>, or through a sponsoring government agency.<sup>1</sup>.

When applying for the SafeTravel Pass, Proof of Residency in Brunei is required. Bruneian Citizens should present a copy of their passport or their yellow ID card for submission. Non-Bruneian Citizens who are resident in Brunei should present a copy of their Bruneian long-term pass ID for submission. Accepted Brunei ID cards include (a) purple ID cards issued to Permanent Residents who are holders of foreign passports and Certificates of Identity, and (b) green ID cards issued to foreigners residing more than 3 months (e.g. holder of employment pass, dependent pass, student pass and visit pass). The applicant will also be required to submit the controlled itinerary for the traveller(s)’ first 14 days of stay in Singapore, which is limited to travel between places of business and accommodation, with limited contact with the community.

The application for the SafeTravel Pass will be open 2 to 5 weeks before the week of the traveller’s planned departure. The processing of the application can take up to 7 days (excluding the day of application). You are encouraged to apply for the SafeTravel Pass as early as possible, factoring in the time necessary for the processing of the SafeTravel Pass application, visa application (if needed) and taking a pre-departure COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.

When the SafeTravel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be issued to the sponsoring company / government agency by email. With this letter, an approved traveller who is a visa-required passport holder will proceed to apply for a visa for travel to Singapore through the usual channels (Singapore overseas missions, authorised visa agents, local contact or companies) at least 4 working days before departure. If the approved traveller already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/she need not apply for a new visa. The traveller can check his/her visa status through <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save>. 

Those who do not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. Bruneian citizens) will not need to apply for a visa for RGL travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

The approved traveller will have to submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations as well as declare his/her accommodation electronically via the SG Arrival Card (<https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/>), within 3 days prior to the date of arrival in Singapore.

Prior to the traveller's departure from Brunei, the sponsoring company or government agency should submit the traveller’s **certificate of negative result for COVID-19 test** taken within 72 hours before departure and **latest controlled itinerary** at <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO>.

The traveller is required to present his/her valid SafeTravel Pass, valid visa (for visa-required passport holders), return air ticket and negative result for a COVID-19 PCR test for pre-boarding checks at the airlines’ check-in counter. Otherwise, he/she may be refused boarding.

#### 6. What are the responsibilities of the host company?

When a company applies for the SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller, it is also responsible for the timely submission of the accompanying documents.

The host company should also ensure that the traveller abides by the terms and conditions of the Singapore-Brunei RGL, and the prevailing health measures during his/her stay in Singapore. Authorities may ask for proof of adherence to the controlled itinerary, including physical verification or SafeEntry Pass records (e.g. screenshots), and other terms and conditions when the traveller is in Singapore.

You can access the terms and conditions of the Singapore-Brunei RGL at <https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/brunei/rgl/terms-and-conditions>. Actions will be taken against the traveller and the host company in the event of non-compliance.

#### 7. Can tourists apply for SafeTravel Passes?

SafeTravel Passes are only issued to travellers making short-term essential business and official travel. These passes are not applicable for tourists.

Foreigners who are short-term travellers travelling from Brunei Darussalam may also seek entry into Singapore by applying for an Air Travel Pass at <https://go.gov.sg/atpsg>. Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass holders are not required to apply for an Air Travel Pass to travel to Singapore from Brunei Darussalam. However, Singapore Long-Term Pass holders will still have to seek entry approval from the relevant Singapore Government agencies before travelling to Singapore.

#### 8. Can my SafeTravel Pass be transferred to my family member, friend, colleague or business partner?

SafeTravel Passes are not transferable to others.

#### 9. Do I need to pay to apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

No payment is required.

#### 10. Is there a limit to the number of times I can apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

There is no limit to the number of times a traveller can apply for a SafeTravel Pass. However, please note that there may be penalties for repeated non-utilisation. Every entry to Singapore requires a new SafeTravel Pass application. 

If the traveller’s SafeTravel Pass has expired, he/she should submit a new application.

#### 11. What visa will I be eligible for under the RGL, and what is the duration of stay that I will be eligible for in Singapore? 

Every application for a visa, including the type of visa granted, will be considered on its own merits and subject to approval. If the approved traveller already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/ she need not apply for a new visa. The traveller can check his/her visa status through <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save>.

Those who did not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. Bruneian citizens) will not need to apply for a visa for RGL travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

Travellers who are granted entry into Singapore are generally issued with a Visit Pass, of which the duration would be aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### 12. How can I further extend my Visit Pass / stay when I am in Singapore, if necessary? 

All applications for extension of Visit Pass must be submitted online using ICA’s e-Service (<https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/extend>) at least seven days prior to the expiry of the Visit Pass to avoid overstaying. Extension of Visit Pass will not be accepted over the counter. Each application is considered on its own merits.

#### 13. My travel plans have changed/some information in my application is incorrect. How can I amend the details of my SafeTravel Pass application/ approved SafeTravel Pass?

Both the SafeTravel Pass application and issued SafeTravel Pass cannot be amended. Please ensure that all details of the application form are accurate at the point of submission.

#### 14. What if I have changes to my controlled itinerary?

The host company should be responsible for monitoring and reporting any deviation in your controlled itinerary. The host company should resubmit the updated controlled itinerary on behalf of the traveller via the ‘Submit Supporting Documents’ Form, at <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO>. Please have the approved STP reference number and documents on hand for submission, and ensure that the amendments or deviation from the controlled itinerary are in accordance with the stipulated guidelines.

#### 15. Can the sponsoring company / agency or traveller check the status of the SafeTravel Pass application?

The sponsoring company/agency or traveller may enquire the status of their application(s) via <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO>. Please have on hand the traveller’s identification details and intended date of entry in Singapore as declared in the STP application.

Travellers coming in on the RGL will be directed to take a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival at Changi Airport or Seletar Airport in Singapore. The traveller must take the COVID-19 PCR test at the assigned swabbing station within the airport. Please approach the airport ground staff upon arrival for assistance.

Travellers are encouraged to pre-register and pre-pay for the COVID-19 PCR test prior to entry into Singapore. Pre-registration and pre-payment can be made on the online portal at <https://safetravel.changiairport.com>. Travellers should expect to pay around S$300 (inclusive of GST) for the test upon arrival at the airport.

Travellers should furnish the relevant supporting documents to indicate their status as an RGL traveller.

Note that all Short-Term Pass Holders will be accorded the necessary medical treatment at their cost. Travellers are encouraged to take up health insurance while travelling.

### **Health Measures in Singapore**

#### 24. What health measures will I be subjected to upon arrival in Singapore?

RGL travellers from Brunei must take a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival in Singapore, and remain isolated in a declared self-sourced accommodation until negative test results are released (typically within 48 hours). The traveller's accommodation throughout the entire duration of his/her stay in Singapore must be a non-residential address and he/she may not reside in a residential address at any point in time. Transportation from the airport/s to the declared accommodation will have to be provided by the host company or government agency subject to prevailing health measures.<sup>2</sup> Travellers will bear the costs of the post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test in Singapore and stay in the declared accommodation.

If the result indicates that the traveller has tested negative for COVID-19, the host company or government agency will ensure that the traveller is transported directly from the declared accommodation to the workplace and back according to the submitted controlled itinerary for up to 14 days of the traveller’s stay in Singapore. The traveller may not use public transportation for this purpose, with the exception of private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport.<sup>3</sup>

Travellers to Singapore must use the TraceTogether app and SafeEntry<sup>4</sup>, take their temperature twice daily, report their health status to the host company or government agency, and adhere to prevailing public health requirements for the duration of their stay in Singapore.

#### 25. What is the TraceTogether app? Does the Singapore Government track my movements via the app?

The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s phone, and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data.

The app works best on phones with Android version 5.1 and above. More information on the app can be found at <https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg>.

#### 26. What is SafeEntry?

SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that logs the NRIC/FINs and mobile numbers of individuals visiting hotspots, workplaces of essential services, as well as selected public venues to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 through activities such as contact tracing and identification of COVID-19 clusters.

More information can be found at <https://www.safeentry.gov.sg>.

### **Returning to Brunei**

#### 27. Do I need to be tested again in Singapore before I return to Brunei? Do I need to be quarantined or be tested again upon return to Brunei?

RGL returnees to Brunei currently do not need to be tested again in Singapore before returning to Brunei.

Upon their arrival back in Brunei, travellers will be subject to a 14-day Isolation Notice, which will be served at the airport, with costs to be borne by the travellers or sponsoring agency. However, returning travellers may qualify for a shortened isolation period upon submitting a negative result from a COVID-19 RT-PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to departure in Singapore.

As the specific requirements may change over time, the returnee should verify the latest requirements with the Brunei government.
