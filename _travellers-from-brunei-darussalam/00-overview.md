The Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL) and Air Travel Pass (ATP) schemes address the needs of different groups of cross-border travellers between Brunei Darussalam and Singapore.

The RGL enables short-term cross-border travel for essential business and official purposes between both countries. Travellers under the RGL scheme are required to comply with the applicable terms and conditions, including undergoing pre-departure and post-arrival COVID-19 PCR tests, abiding by a pre-declared controlled itinerary during their visit, and downloading and using TraceTogether for their entire period of stay.

The ATP scheme enables short-term visitors from Brunei Darussalam entry into Singapore. Short-term visitors under the ATP scheme are required to apply for an ATP, and comply with the conditions of the ATP. These include undergoing a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival in Singapore, in lieu of a Stay-Home Notice (SHN), and downloading and using TraceTogether for their entire period of stay.
