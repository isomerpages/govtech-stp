### **Overview**

On 21 August 2020, Singapore announced the lifting of border restrictions to allow entry of visitors travelling from Brunei Darussalam. Foreigners who are short-term visitors travelling from Brunei Darussalam may seek entry into Singapore by applying for an Air Travel Pass.

Singapore Citizens, Singapore Permanent Residents, and Singapore Long-Term Pass holders are not required to apply for an Air Travel Pass to travel to Singapore from Brunei Darussalam. However, Singapore Long-Term Pass holders will still have to seek entry approval from the relevant Singapore Government agencies before travelling to Singapore. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19/arrivalsg> for the prevailing health measures applicable to you upon entry into Singapore.

### **Application**

From 1 September 2020, foreigners who are short-term visitors may apply for an Air Travel Pass for entry into Singapore on or after 8 September 2020. They can apply for an Air Travel Pass at no charge. Applications must be made between seven and thirty calendar days prior to the visitor’s intended date of entry into Singapore. The Air Travel Pass is valid for single entry into Singapore anytime from the visitor’s intended date of entry and up to seven calendar days after.

Visitors must comply with the [Conditions](/brunei/atp/conditions) of the Air Travel Pass, and the prevailing immigration requirements of the Singapore Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) for their entry and stay in Singapore. When the Air Travel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be sent to the applicant via email. 

Visitors who do not meet the Air Travel Pass conditions may be refused entry into Singapore and/or have their Air Travel Pass cancelled. In such an event, visitors may also be liable for the cost of their repatriation, including custody and maintenance pending repatriation. In addition, their future Air Travel Pass applications may also be rejected.

Personal data will be collected for Air Travel Pass applications. Please click [here](/privacy) to view the Privacy Statement.

For enquiries, please email <COVID_ATP_Enquiries@caas.gov.sg>.

### **Important**

Given the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the relevant authorities in Singapore may, at their own discretion, introduce new measures or requirements to safeguard public health. This may include changes to the conditions or cancellation of the Air Travel Pass at short notice. Visitors will be notified of changes to the conditions or cancellation of their Air Travel Passes.

## **Process Overview**

### **Before Travelling to Singapore**

#### Visa Requirements

Visitors who hold a visa-required passport must separately obtain a valid visa prior to departure for Singapore. Such visitors are strongly encouraged to apply for their Air Travel Pass early.

If the visitor already has an existing valid visa which has been suspended due to COVID-19, ICA will lift the suspension and there is no need to obtain a new visa. Information on visa requirements and application can be found on ICA’s [website](https://www.ica.gov.sg/visitor/visitor_entryvisa).

#### Pre-Departure

Prior to departing for Singapore, a visitor holding an Air Travel Pass must:
- remain in Brunei Darussalam in the last 14 consecutive days before departing for Singapore;
- monitor his/her health status before departure;
- book an accommodation in Singapore to serve out his/her isolation period for 1-2 days while waiting for his/her post-arrival COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result<sup>1</sup>. The accommodation<sup>2</sup> must be non-residential and must be an individual room with an attached toilet; 
- check that his/her mobile device is compatible<sup>3</sup> with the TraceTogether app and [download](https://tracetogether.gov.sg/) it on his/her mobile device<sup>4</sup>; and 
- submit his/her health, travel history, and accommodation declarations electronically via the [SG Arrival Card](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard), no earlier than three days prior to his/her date of arrival in Singapore.

Visitors are also strongly encouraged to [register and pre-pay](https://safetravel.changiairport.com/#/) for their post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test prior to departing for Singapore. 

When checking in at the departure airport, the visitor must present to the airline staff:
- a valid Air Travel Pass approval letter (electronic or physical copy) for the specified period of entry into Singapore;
- a valid visa (for visa-required passport holders); and
- a mobile device with the TraceTogether app downloaded.

A visitor who does not have any of the above may be refused boarding by the airline.

### **Arrival and Stay in Singapore**

#### Arrival

At arrival immigration in Singapore, the visitor must present to the ICA officer:
- a valid Air Travel Pass approval letter (electronic or physical copy) for the specified period of entry into Singapore;
- a valid visa (for visa-required passport holders); and
- a mobile device with the TraceTogether app downloaded.

A visitor who does not have any of the above may be refused entry into Singapore by ICA.

A visitor holding an Air Travel Pass will undergo a COVID-19 PCR test at the airport upon arrival in Singapore. After undergoing the test, the visitor must take private transportation, taxi, or private hire car to travel from the airport to his/her declared accommodation, and remain in isolation at that accommodation until he/she is notified that his/her test result is negative. The visitor shall also bear any transportation and accommodation costs incurred.

If the visitor tests negative for COVID-19, the visitor can leave his/her accommodation and go about his/her activities in Singapore. Visitors must be responsible for their medical bills should they require medical treatment for COVID-19 while in Singapore.

#### During and After Stay in Singapore

Visitors must adhere to the prevailing public health measures during their stay in Singapore, which include wearing of masks and safe distancing.

To facilitate contact tracing, visitors must keep the TraceTogether app activated on their mobile devices while in Singapore. They are also required to retain the TraceTogether app with the data for 14 consecutive days after leaving Singapore. A visitor must upload all data in the TraceTogether app upon request by the Singapore Ministry of Health should he/she test positive for COVID-19 while in Singapore or in the first 14 days after leaving Singapore.
