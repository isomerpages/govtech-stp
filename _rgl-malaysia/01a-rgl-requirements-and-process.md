On 14 July 2020, Singapore and Malaysia agreed to implement the Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL) to facilitate short-term essential business and official travel between both countries.

The SafeTravel Pass is a mandatory document for in-bound travellers for short-term essential business and official travel from Malaysia to Singapore via the Singapore-Malaysia RGL.

The RGL is only applicable for travel between (i) airports in Singapore and Malaysia which have available non-stop flight routes and (ii) land checkpoints.

### **Application**

Business or official travellers seeking to make essential travel via the RGL to Singapore from Malaysia must be sponsored  by either a Singapore-based company or a Singapore Government agency, which will file an application on behalf of the applicant for a SafeTravel Pass.

### **Important**

Travellers (who are not Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents or Long-Term Pass holders) without a valid SafeTravel Pass will be refused entry into Singapore.

## **Process Overview**

### **Before Entering Singapore**

#### Visa Requirements

When the SafeTravel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be sent via email to the sponsoring company or government agency.

With the SafeTravel Pass approval, an approved applicant who is a visa-required passport holder can proceed to apply for a visa for travel to Singapore through the usual channels. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/she need not apply for a new visa.  The applicant can check his/her visa status through [this page](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save).

**Those who do not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will not need to apply for a visa for Green/ Fast Lane travel.** Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

The approved applicant will have to electronically submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations and declare his/her accommodation in Singapore via the [SG Arrival Card](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/), before departing for Singapore. The SG Arrival Card can also be accessed via the [Visit Singapore Travel Guide App](https://www.visitsingapore.com/travel-guide-tips/visit-singapore-travel-guide-app/).

Travellers who are granted entry into Singapore are generally issued with a Visit Pass, of which the duration would be aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### Pre-Departure Measures

Prior to travelling to Singapore, approved SafeTravel Pass travellers are required to:
- Monitor their health status and refrain from travelling to Singapore if feeling unwell;
- Have not travelled out of Malaysia in the entirety of the 14 days prior to departure; 
- Take a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 72 hours from departure and obtain a certificate of having tested negative for COVID-19. The certificate must be from the accredited laboratories by the Ministry of Health Malaysia. The SafeTravel Pass applicant will bear the cost of the pre-departure PCR test.

Travellers entering Singapore by air are also strongly encouraged to [register and pre-pay](https://safetravel.changiairport.com/#/) for their post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test prior to departing for Singapore. 

In the event that the visitors is unable to make payment before departing to Singapore, please ensure that he/she has a mobile phone with an activated line upon arrival, as on-site payment would typically require an OTP being sent to the phone.

Travellers entering Singapore by air and land are required to produce the following documents to the airline for pre-boarding checks and at the immigration counter respectively:
- A valid SafeTravel Pass approval letter (the date of entry into Singapore must fall within the period of entry stated in the letter). Each SafeTravel Pass is valid for a single entry into Singapore;
- A valid visa to enter Singapore (for visa-required passport holders who are short-term visitors to Singapore); and
- A valid certificate of negative result for a COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours before departure for Singapore (the certificate must be from the accredited laboratories by the Ministry of Health Malaysia).

Travellers entering Singapore by air who do not produce the documents above at pre-boarding checks can be refused boarding.

### **Arrival and Stay in Singapore**

#### Post-Arrival Measures

The SafeTravel Pass traveller will undergo a COVID-19 PCR test at the airport/land checkpoint upon arrival in Singapore. The SafeTravel Pass traveller will bear the costs of the post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test in Singapore.

At arrival immigration, approved SafeTravel Pass travellers should declare he/she is a SafeTravel Pass holder, and must produce:

- A valid SafeTravel Pass for the intended week of travel,
- A valid visa (for visa-required passport holders),
- A negative COVID-19 PCR test result,
- **For arrivals by air**, a return air ticket must be produced.

Approved travellers without these documents will be refused entry into Singapore under the RGL arrangement. 

The host<sup>2</sup> company or government agency will transport the traveller directly from the airport/land checkpoint to the declared self-sourced accommodation, adhering to prevailing health measures. The applicant must remain in the declared accommodation (non-residential address only) until a negative test result from the post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test is released. Thereafter, the traveller can proceed on the pre-declared controlled itinerary. The host company or government agency is responsible for monitoring the traveller’s adherence to the controlled itinerary.

If tested positive for COVID-19, the traveller will undergo medical treatment at his/her cost.
