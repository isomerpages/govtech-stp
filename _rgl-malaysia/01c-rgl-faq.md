SafeTravel Passes will be issued on a limited basis in order to manage the risk of imported COVID-19 cases.

Please send an email to <COVID_SafeTravelEnquiries@mti.gov.sg> if you have further queries related to the SafeTravel Pass.

#### 4. How do residents in Malaysia apply for a SafeTravel Pass to travel to Singapore under the RGL? What are the steps from the time I put in an application to the time I obtain a SafeTravel Pass? How long is the processing time? What documents do I need to submit?

Residents in Malaysia seeking to travel to Singapore via the RGL must be hosted by a company or a government agency in Singapore. The host company can file the application for a SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller either directly at <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO>, or through a sponsoring government agency.<sup>1</sup>.

When applying for the SafeTravel Pass, Proof of Residency in Malaysia is required. Malaysian Citizens should present a copy of their passport for submission. Non-Malaysian Citizens who are resident in Malaysia should present a copy of their Malaysian long-term pass ID for submission. The applicant will also be required to submit the controlled itinerary for the traveller(s)’ first 14 days of stay in Singapore, which is limited to travel between places of business and accommodation, with limited contact with the community.

The application for the SafeTravel Pass will be open 2 to 5 weeks before the week of the traveller’s planned departure. The processing of the application can take up to 7 days (excluding the day of application). You are encouraged to apply for the SafeTravel Pass as early as possible, factoring in the time necessary for the processing of the SafeTravel Pass application, visa application (if needed) and taking a pre-departure COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.

When the SafeTravel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be issued to the sponsoring company / government agency by email within 3 working days. With this letter, an approved applicant who is a visa-required passport holder will proceed to apply for a visa for travel to Singapore through the usual channels (Singapore overseas missions, authorised visa agents, local contact or companies) at least 4 working days before departure. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status through <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save>.

Those who do not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. Malaysian citizens) will not need to apply for a visa for RGL travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

The approved applicant will have to submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations as well as declare his/her accommodation electronically via the SG Arrival Card (<https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/>), within 3 days prior to the date of arrival in Singapore.

Prior to the traveller’s departure from Malaysia, the sponsoring company or government agency should submit the traveller’s **certificate of negative result for COVID-19 test** taken within 72 hours before departure and **latest controlled itinerary in Singapore** at <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO>.

Travellers arriving in Singapore by air are required to present their valid SafeTravel Pass, valid visa (for visa-required passport holders), return air ticket and negative result for a COVID-19 PCR test for pre-boarding checks at the airlines’ check-in counter and immigration counter. Otherwise, he/she may be refused boarding.

Travellers arriving in Singapore via land checkpoints are required to present their valid SafeTravel Pass, valid visa (for visa-required passport holders), and negative result for COVID-19 PCR test result.

Travellers who are granted entry into Singapore are generally issued with a Visit Pass, of which the duration would be aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### 5. What are the responsibilities of the host company?

When a company is sponsoring a traveller, it will have to be responsible for the application of the SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller as well as the timely submission of the accompanying documents.

The host company should also ensure that the traveller abides by the terms and conditions of the Singapore-Malaysia RGL, and the prevailing health measures during his/her stay in Singapore. Authorities may ask for proof of adherence, including physical verification or SafeEntry Pass records (e.g. screenshots), to the controlled itinerary and other terms and conditions when the traveller is in Singapore.

You can access the terms and conditions of the Singapore-Malaysia RGL at <https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/malaysia/rgl/terms-and-conditions>. Actions will be taken against the traveller and the host company in the event of non-compliance.

#### 6. Can tourists apply for SafeTravel Passes?

SafeTravel Passes are only issued to travellers making short-term essential business and official travel. These passes are not applicable for tourists.

#### 7. Can my SafeTravel Pass be transferred to my family member, friend, colleague or business partner?

SafeTravel Passes are not transferable to others.

#### 8. Do I need to pay to apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

No payment is required.

#### 9. Is there a limit to the number of times I can apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

#### 10. What visa will I be eligible for under the RGL, and what is the duration of stay that I will be eligible for in Singapore?

Every application for a visa, including the type of visa granted, will be considered on its own merits and subject to approval. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/ she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status through <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save>.

Those who do not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. Malaysian citizens) will not need to apply for a visa for RGL travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

Travellers who are granted entry into Singapore are generally issued with a Visit Pass, of which the duration would be aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### 11. How can I further extend my Visit Pass / stay when I am in Singapore, if neccessary? 

All applications for extension of Visit Pass must be submitted online using ICA's [e-Service](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/extend) at least seven days prior to the expiry of the Visit Pass to avoid overstaying. Extension of Visit Pass will not be accepted over the counter. Each application is considered on its own merits.

#### 14. Can the sponsoring company / agency or traveller check the status of the SafeTravel Pass application?

The sponsoring company/agency or traveller may make enquiries about the status of their application(s) via <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO>. Please prepare the traveller’s identification details and intended date of entry in Singapore as declared in the STP application.

#### 15. Why was my application rejected?

### **Health Measures in Singapore**

#### 23. What health measures will I be subjected to upon arrival in Singapore?

If the result indicates that the traveller has tested negative for COVID-19, the host company or government agency will ensure that the traveller is transported directly from the declared accommodation to the workplace and back according to the submitted controlled itinerary for the traveller’s stay in Singapore. The traveller may not use public transportation for this purpose, with the exception of private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport.<sup>4</sup>

Travellers to Singapore must use the TraceTogether app and SafeEntry<sup>5</sup>, take their temperature twice daily, report their health status to the host company or government agency, and adhere to prevailing public health requirements for the duration of their stay in Singapore.

#### 24. What is the TraceTogether app? Does the Singapore Government track my movements via the app?

The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s phone, and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data.

The app works best on phones with Android version 5.1 and above. More information on the app can be found at <https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg>.

#### 25. What is SafeEntry?

SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that logs the NRIC/FINs and mobile numbers of individuals visiting hotspots, workplaces of essential services, as well as selected public venues to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 through activities such as contact tracing and identification of COVID-19 clusters.

An existing check-in method is via scanning of a QR code at the venue with a camera phone or a QR scanner app. Hence, you are encouraged to purchase a Singapore local data SIM card, or connect your mobile phone to a Singapore local Wi-Fi network to access the form for this mode of check-in. 
 
Alternatively, some venues allow you to complete SafeEntry by presenting your passport as identification. Establishments will assist visitors with manual SafeEntry check-in.

More information can be found at <https://www.safeentry.gov.sg>.

#### 26. Do I need to be tested again in Singapore before I return to Malaysia? Do I need to be quarantined or be tested again upon return to Malaysia?

RGL returnees to Malaysia currently do not need to be tested again in Singapore before returning to Malaysia.

Upon their arrival back in Malaysia, they must adhere to the prevailing COVID-19 prevention and control measures of the Malaysian government. As the specific requirements may change over time, the returnee should verify the latest requirements with the relevant Malaysian authorities.
